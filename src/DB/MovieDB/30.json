 "Plot": [
  "severine is a beautiful young woman married to a doctor. she loves her husband dearly, but cannot bring herself to be physically intimate with him. she indulges instead in vivid, kinky, erotic fantasies to entertain her sexual desires. eventually she becomes a prostitute, working in a brothel in the afternoons while remaining chaste in her marriage.", 
  "severine serizy, happily married to a handsome young surgeon, goes to work in a house of ill repute, actually an intimate apartment. the money involved is less the motivation than the pretext for her action. pierre, her husband, provides for her material needs handsomely, but his respectfully temporizing caresses fail to satisfy her psychic need for brutal degradation, a need first awakened by a child molester when she was eight. to preserve a facade of marital respectability, severine works at her obsessive profession only afternoons from two to five, the mystery of her matin\u00e9e schedule causing her to be christened belle de jour.", 
  "in paris, the bored and frigid upper-class housewife s\u00e9verine serizy is married with the handsome doctor pierre serizy, and she fantasizes kink sex with strangers every now and then. pierre's friend henri husson and his wife renee are frequently meeting pierre and s\u00e9verine and after having lunch together, renee tells to s\u00e9verine that their acquaintance henriette is working in a whorehouse and husson gives the address of a high-class brothel in paris. s\u00e9verine visits madam anais in her brothel and is hired to work from 2:00 pm to 5:00 pm with the nickname \"belle de jour\". the young client marcel has a crush on s\u00e9verine and becomes her prime client. however, when husson discovers that s\u00e9verine is working in the whorehouse, she decides to quit the job. but marcel does not intend to loose her."
