 "Plot": [
  "after jointly winning a local drag queen pageant in new york city, noxeema jackson and vida boheme win the right and are given the round trip airfare to compete in the drag queen of america pageant in hollywood, california. noxeema sees herself as the next", 
  "after vida boheme and noxeema jackson win a major new york drag contest and a trip to hollywood, they are persuaded to take the inexperienced drag princess chi-chi with them. they hire a beat-up old cadillac and set off for los angeles, but their car breaks down in a small town in the middle of nowhere. with just their wits and an endless supply of garish costumes, they transform the town and everyone who lives there--until homophobic cop sheriff dollard catches up with them...", 
  "a road trip with style and panache, two drag queens, noxeema and vida, and newbie and wannabe drag queen chi-chi travel across america for the drag queen finals in hollywood. with a cheap second-hand cadillac convertible for transport it's fun and adventure all the way. that is, until the old banger conks out and they're stuck in the middle of nowhere, in dusty and dry small-town, backwater, plainsville. hot on their tails, too, is homophobic, redneck sheriff dollard, and he's as mad as hell, and he's \"gonna get these men in dresses\". with having to teach the young newbie the ways of becoming a fully fledged queen, an angry cop, small-town blues and the locals having to adjust to these new, strange and colourful individuals, it all makes-up for fun, frolics and home truths from both sides of the fence. a ride on the open road and a chance meeting, this is more than just minds, friendship and fate opening up in the unlikeliest of places."
