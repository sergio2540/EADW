 "Plot": [
  "this movie chronicles the life and times of r. crumb. robert crumb is the cartoonist/artist who drew keep on truckin', fritz the cat, and played a major pioneering role in the genesis of underground comix. through interviews with his mother, two brothers, wife, and ex-girlfriends, as well as selections from his vast quantity of graphic art, we are treated to a darkly comic ride through one man's subconscious mind. as stream-of-consciousness images incessantly flow forth from the tip of his pen, biting social satire is revealed, often along with a disturbing and haunting vision of crumb's own betes noires and inadequacies. as his acid-trip induced images flicker across our own retinas, we gain a little insight into this complex and highly creative individual."
