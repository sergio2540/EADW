  "joe sullivan is itching to get out of prison. he's taken the rap for rick, who owes him $50 grand. rick sets up an escape for joe, knowing that joe will be caught escaping and be shot or locked away forever. but with the help of his love-struck girl pat and his sympathetic legal caseworker ann, joe gets further than he's supposed to, and we are posed with two very important questions: is joe really the cold and heartless criminal he appears to be, or is there a heart of gold under that gritty exterior? and does joe belong with the tough, street-wise pat, or with the prim, moralizing ann?"
