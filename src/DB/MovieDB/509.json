 "Plot": [
  "christy brown is a spastic quadriplegic born to a large, poor irish family. his mother, mrs brown, recognizes the intelligence and humanity in the lad everyone else regards as a vegetable. eventually, christy matures into a cantankerous writer who uses his only functional limb, his left foot, to write with.", 
  "in this true story told through flashbacks, christy brown is born with crippling cerebral palsy into a poor, working-class irish family. able only to control movement in his left foot and to speak in guttural sounds, he is mistakenly believed to be retarded for the first ten years of his life. later, through the help of his strong-willed mother, a dedicated teacher, and his own courage and determination, christy not only learns to grapple with life's simple physical tasks and complex psychological pains, but he also develops into a brilliant painter, poet and author."
