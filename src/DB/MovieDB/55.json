  "mathilda, a twelve-year old new york girl, is living an undesirable life among her half-family. her father stores drugs for two-faced cop norman stansfield. only her little brother keeps mathilda from breaking apart. one day, stansfield and his team take cruel revenge on her father for stretching the drugs a little, thus killing the whole family. only mathilda, who was out shopping, survives by finding shelter in l\u00e9on's apartment in the moment of highest need. soon, she finds out about the strange neighbour's unusual profession - killing - and desperately seeks his help in taking revenge for her little brother. l\u00e9on, who is completely unexperienced in fatherly tasks, and in friendships, does his best to keep mathilda out of trouble - unsuccessfully. now, the conflict between a killer, who slowly discovers his abilities to live, to feel, to love and a corrupt police officer, who does anything in his might to get rid of an eye witness, arises to unmeasurable proportions - all for the sake of a little twelve-year old girl, who has nearly nothing to lose.",

  "leon is a hitman, and happy with his life. when a young girl comes home to find her family has been killed by a drug dealer, she runs to him for help. when she discovers he is a hitman, she asks him to teach her the skills to take her revenge.", 
  "leon is a first-class hit man, but is also a sensitive guy who loves his potted plants. he is moral: \"no women, no children\" is his professional motto. he is sympathetic to his neighbor, mathilda, a typically rebellious twelve-year-old who has trouble with her family. but when her father runs afoul of drug kingpin norman stansfield, mathilda turns to leon for assistance."

 "Synopsis": "l\u00e9on (jean reno) is a hitman (or \"cleaner\" as he would rather be known) living a solitary life in new york city's little italy. most of his work comes from a mafioso named tony (danny aiello), who operates from the \"supreme macaroni company\" retail store. l\u00e9on spends his idle time engaging in calisthenics, nurturing a houseplant that early on he describes as his \"best friend\", and (in one scene) watching old gene kelly musicals.\n\nl\u00e9on is highly motivated and efficient. he kills plenty of bodyguards (ed ventresca) so that a fat guy called fatman (frank senger) receives a phonecall threatening him. a dumb blonde (ouin-ouin) walks away non-noncommittally and says she will call him later, not wanting to get involved in the matter.\n\non a particular day on his way home, he sees mathilda lando (natalie portman), a twelve-year-old girl with a black eye and smoking a cigarette, living with her dysfunctional family in an apartment down the hallway. mathilda's father (michael badalucco) attracts the ire of corrupt dea agents, who have been paying him to store cocaine in his residence, after they discover that he has been stealing some of the drugs for himself. a cadre of dea agents storm the building, led by a ragged and drug-addicted norman \"stan\" stansfield (gary oldman), murders mathilda's entire family; the whore-looking mother (ellen greene), the aerobic-obsessed elder sister (elizabeth regen) and the friend little brother (carl j. matusovich)- missing her only because she was out shopping when they arrived. an elderly lady (jessie keosian) comes back inquiring what the rackas is about, and stan shoots the glass behind her, but considers her harmless so he lets her be, just barking at her \"go back inside\" when she returns with the groceries she was sent to buy and notices the carnage, she calmly continues down the hallway past the open door of her family's apartment, and receives sanctuary from a reluctant l\u00e9on. one of the agents () looks at mathilda, quizzingly, as she has and insist ringing the bell on and on before l\u00e9on lets her in. stan realises that there's a little girl missing because of a family photograph he's found. when the news reaches the door guard, he approaches l\u00e9on's apartment, wondering whether the girl who was accepted there was the missing girl. l\u00e9on prepares himself to shoot him, watching through a hidden peephole, but at that moment, mathilda turns on the tv with some  transformers  cartoons, which convinces the guard that he saw another girl who had nothing to do with the situation.\n\nle\u00f3n offers some consolation to mathilda, making her smile when he argues than pigs smell well and are better than many people, and make-pretends that the puppet pig he's using is talking to her. mathilda, who soon discovers that l\u00e9on is a hitman, begs him to become her caretaker, and to teach her his skills as a \"cleaner\": she wants to avenge the murder of her four-year-old brother, the only member of her family that she actually loved. in return, she offers herself as a maid and teacher, remedying l\u00e9on's illiteracy. mathilda says that he could have let her to die outside that door, but as he opened it, now he's responsible for her well-being. at first, l\u00e9on refuses point blank: being a \"cleaner\" is not a job for girls, and then he alleges that she's not made for that. to answer to that, mathilda shoots some pigeons with one of the guns l\u00e9on is cleaning. l\u00e9on hesitantly accepts her offer and the two begin working together, slowly building an emotional attachment, with l\u00e9on becoming a friend and father figure.\n\nthey leave l\u00e9on's apartment, and l\u00e9on begins to settle some rules. mathilda carries le\u00f3n's plant, accepting everything, and convinces the receptionist (george martin) that she's preparing for an audition, and that she won't practice after 10. when the receptionist asks l\u00e9on to fill up the registration form, mathilda jumps right in and says \"you know how much i love registering. can i do it, daddy?\" l\u00e9on breaths, and apprecciates that mathilda is resourceful. the receptionist congratulates l\u00e9on because he's got a good daughter, but he's got a 17-year-old who can't do anything. le\u00f3n leaves his plant at reception. he checks everything in the room, the exits, the windows, while mathilda fills up the form. as they work together, mathilda admits to l\u00e9on several times that she is falling in love with him, in spite of him making her drink a glass of milk every day.\n\ntony has been keeping l\u00e9on money, instead of being put into a bank. as l\u00e9on was illiterate, he didn't want to have to deal with it. l\u00e9on asks if he could give it to somebody; tony tells him that he's like a bank, only that there's not paperwork involved, but that he's got all the accountancy in his wind. tony wants l\u00e9on to renew work, as training won't earn him any money. l\u00e9on prevents mathilda from flirting with a guy (michael mundra) a little older than herself; she replies that they were only sharing a cigarette - to which l\u00e9on answer that he wants her to quit smoking. l\u00e9on adds that she should stay away from him, as he looks like a weirdo. l\u00e9on goes to work on his own on foot. mathilda says that she's fed up of practicing to the receptionist. mathilda tells him that l\u00e9on is not her father, but her lover, and that she's going for walk. mathilda goes back to her old flat, and picks up a teddy bear and a pad of money hidden under a loose wooden plank. she has to hide, because the fbi is questioning stan, who is being a jackass about the people he killed in the line of duty. he shouts to the fbi guy that kids should be at school, and also shouts his office number.\n\nmathilday follows stan by taxi, telling the driver (abdul hassan sharif) to shut the fuck up and drive. she follows him to the police station. mathilda is watching  transformers  again when l\u00e9on arrives with blood in an arm and a pink dress for her. the receptionist arrives with two men, throwing both of them out. in another hotel room, l\u00e9on has a shower and stitches himself in the chest, where he's been hurt. mathilda wants to pay l\u00e9on to kill his brother's killers, but l\u00e9on doesn't want to. he tells that life changes after the first time you kill somebody. she wants to play the russian roulette with him. she threatens him with killing herself - and at the last second he pushes the pistol away. mathilda and l\u00e9on go talk with tony.\n\nas mathilda increases her confidence and experience, she locates stansfield, follows him to his office in the dea building in an attempt to kill him, only to be ambushed by stansfield in a bathroom. l\u00e9on, discovering her intentions after reading a note left for him by mathilda, rushes to the building and rescues her, shooting two of stansfield's men in the process.\n\nstansfield is enraged that what he calls the \"italian hitman\" has gone rogue and is killing his men. he confronts tony and threatens him, eventually beating him into surrendering l\u00e9on's whereabouts. later, as mathilda returns home from grocery shopping, an nypd esu team, sent by stansfield, takes her hostage and attempts to infiltrate l\u00e9on's apartment. l\u00e9on ambushes the esu team and takes one of their members hostage, rapidly bartering him for mathilda's freedom. as they slink back into the apartment, l\u00e9on creates a quick escape for matilda as he reassures her and tells her that he loves her moments before they come for him.\n\nin the chaos that follows, l\u00e9on sneaks out of the apartment building disguised as a wounded esu officer, almost unnoticed save for stansfield who recognizes him and silently sneaks up and shoots him from behind. looming over the dying l\u00e9on, stansfield jeers him haughtily. however just before he gives out, l\u00e9on places an object in stansfield's hands, which he explains is \"from mathilda\". opening his hands, stansfield recognizes it as the pin from a grenade and rips open l\u00e9on's vest to discover several grenades on his chest. stansfield lets out a brief and final quip \"oh, shit\" right before a massive explosion devastates them both.\n\nmathilda heads to tony's place as she was instructed to do by l\u00e9on. tony will not give mathilda more than a few dollars of the fortune l\u00e9on had amassed, which was being held by tony. his reasoning is that she is not old enough to receive the large amount of money and that school should be her priority until she's older. when mathilda asks tony to give her a 'job', and insists that she can 'clean' as l\u00e9on had, tony sternly informs her that he 'ain't got no work for a 12-year-old kid!' having nowhere else to go, she is then seen going to roosevelt island using the roosevelt island tramway. the next day, she returns to school in nj. seemingly readmitted to the school, mathilda walks into a field in front of it with l\u00e9on's houseplant in hand, she digs a hole and plants the houseplant in the grounds of the school, as she had told l\u00e9on he should, \"to give it roots.\"\n\n\n\npeter appel\tpeter appel\t...\tmalky\nwilli one blood\twilli one blood\t...\t1st stansfield man (as willie one
