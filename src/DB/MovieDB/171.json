 "Plot": [
  "the story is centered on a microcosm of a post-apocalyptic society where food is so rare it's invaluable and is used as currency. the story centers on an apartment building with a delicatessen on the ground floor. the owner of the eatery also owns the apartment building and he is in need of a new maintenance man since the original \"mysteriously\" disappeared. a former clown applies for the job and the butcher's intent is to have him work for a little while and then serve him to quirky tenants who pay the butcher in, of course, grain. the clown and butcher's daughter fall in love and she tries to foil her father's plans by contacting the \"troglodytes\", a grain eating sub-group of society who live entirely underground. the \"trogs\" are possibly the most sensible of the lot, as they see food as food and not money.", 
  "delicatessen is a story of about a small community living within an apartment building during a post-apocalyptic era. after an ex-clown named louison, played by dominique pinon, reads of a handyman position available at the apartment building, he decides to move in. in this new world of famine, food is a rare commodity and people will do whatever is necessary for survival. the owner of the apartment building is also the butcher who works in the butcher shop on the first floor. it is here that the tenants are given their rations of human flesh which is paid for with corn, their primary currency. what louison does not realize is that his position was opened because the previous handymen have been murdered and eaten, and his new employer does not intend for him to be an exception. however, the butcher's daughter grows quite fond of louison and interferes with her father's plot to kill him by hiring an underground society to capture and extract louison to safety.", 
  "in a post-apocalyptic world, the residents of an apartment above the butcher shop receive an occasional delicacy of meat, something that is in low supply. a young man new in town falls in love with the butcher's daughter, which causes conflicts in her family, who need the young man for other business-related purposes.", 
  "an ex-clown turns up seeking work at an ancient tenament in the middle of nowhere. little does he know that the landlord, a butcher, feeds his tenants, in these days of extreme food shortages, on fattened up handymen."
