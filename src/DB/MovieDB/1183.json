  "sonny and pepper are two cowboys from new mexico who compete in rodeos, but their friendship's been strained when pepper fails to show up at a major competition. they are fortunate that sonny's cook, nacho acts as a buffer between them. after his peace making efforts fail, nacho goes home, he then gets a phone call from someone telling him that his daughter, teresa has just arrived in new york from cuba. but the man tells him that he still has an unpaid balance, which of course he doesn't have. nacho then leaves and goes to new york and leaves sonny a note. when sonny reads the note, he proceeds to follow him but he's broke, so he asks pepper if he will loan him some; pepper decides to go with him. the two bicker along the way. when they get there they get help from a new york policeman, sam shaw. they find nacho in the morgue. all what's left for them to do is find teresa."
