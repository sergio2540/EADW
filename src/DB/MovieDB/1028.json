  "things don't seem to change much in wabasha county: max and john are still fighting after 35 years, grandpa still drinks, smokes, and chases women , and nobody's been able to catch the fabled \"catfish hunter\", a gigantic catfish that actually smiles at fishermen who try to snare it. six months ago john married the new girl in town (ariel), and people begin to suspect that max might be missing something similar in his life. the only joy max claims is left in his life is fishing, but that might change with the new owner of the bait shop."
