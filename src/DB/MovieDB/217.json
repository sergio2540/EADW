'i love you too much to condemn you,' he explains.\nsuddenly, van helsing et al burst in the room. they attempt to destroy\ndracula, but he changes into hundreds of rats and scurries away.\n\ndracula knows that he cannot stay in england any longer and books\npassage back to transylvania via varna. mina and the men follow close\nbehind. as dracula is in mind contact with mina, van helsing knows\ndracula's plans but dracula also seems to know theirs. instead of sailing\ninto varna, dracula diverts the ship 200 miles north and lands at galatz,\ncausing a change in plans such that van helsing and mina take a carriage\ndirectly from varna to the borgo pass while jonathan, quincey, arthur, and\njack continue by train to galanz where they secure horses and ride for the\nborgo pass, hoping to cut off dracula. they are unsuccessful. dracula's\ngypsies picked up his earthbox at galanz and are now speeding down the\nborgo pass road. it's going to be a close race.\n\nmina and van helsing are almost to the castle but decide to stop for\nthe night. van helsing casts a circle around mina and protects her by\nburning her forehead with a blessed communion wafer. in the circle they\nstay through the night while dracula's three brides tempt mina to join\nthem. the next morning, as mina sleeps in the circle, van helsing visits\nthe castle and beheads the vampiresses, throwing them all into the gorge.\n\nit is near sundown. the gypsy wagon bearing dracula in his earthbox\napproaches the castle. jonathan, arthur, quincey, and jack are riding hard\nto catch up. mina and van helsing wait inside the castle courtyard. mina\ncalls up a blue flame to protect dracula. as the gypsy wagon enters the\ncourtyard, a gypsy stabs quincey in the back. jonathan attempts to open\ndracula's earthbox, but the sun has set and dracula rises. at that very\nmoment, however, jonathan slits dracula's neck and quincey stabs dracula\nthrough the heart with a sword. mina screams. as arthur races forward to\nfinish dracula, harker stops him. 'let them go,' he says. 'our work is\nfinished here; hers is just begun.'\n\nas quincey dies, mina sits with dracula on the chapel floor inside\nthe castle. she kisses him, and he begs her to give him peace. then, out\nof love, she pushes the sword the rest of the way through dracula's heart.\nthe burn on her forehead disappears, dracula dies, and mina releases him\nby cutting off his head.
