  "in medieval france, young lawyer richard courtois leaves paris for the simpler life in the country. however, he is soon drawn into amorous and political intrigues. at the same time, he is pushed to defend a pig, owned by the mysterious gypsy samira. the pig has been arrested for the murder of a young boy.", 
  "set in 15th century france. a parisian lawyer wearies of the cynical sophistication of the capital and solicits appointment as the public defender in a remote, rural province. he finds himself expected to defend a pig in a murder trial. (as the public prosector says, \"anyone who knows animals knows there are good ones and bad ones.\") what initially appears to be a case based on simple rural superstition turns out to conceal a far worse corruption. eventually the lawyer returns to the capital, having learned that cynical sophistication is not so easily evaded."
