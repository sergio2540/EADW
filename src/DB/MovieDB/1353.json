  "sarah, 30, single, well educated, likes art, places a voice ad for phone sex, inviting replies from men under 35, sturdy and sensual. wilbert, a chubby middle aged architect, leaves a message that he is thomas, 32 and well formed. a week later, she phones. she likes his voice, he likes her laugh, so once a week she phones him (he's not to know her last name, where she lives, or her number). portraits emerge of humor and sadness. he presses for details of her life and tells her about his work; she wants these thursday calls to be fantasy and release, separate from the rest of who she is. the film dramatizes these tensions of lies and truth, connection and distance."
