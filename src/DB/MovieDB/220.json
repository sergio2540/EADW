 "Plot": [
  "rose and gregory, both columbia university professors meet when rose's sister answers gregory's \"personals\" ad. several times burned, the handsome-but-boring gregory believes that sex has ruined his life, and has deliberately set out to find and marry a woman with absolutely no sex appeal. greg thinks he's found what he's looking for in rose, a plain, plump english lit professor who can't compete with her gorgeous mother and sister. more out of mutual admiration and respect than love, greg and rose marry. greg assumes that rose understands that he is not interested in a sexual relationship. he's mistaken, and their marriage is nearly destroyed when rose tries to consummate their relationship. while gregory is out of the country on a lecture tour, rose diets and exercises to transform herself into a sexy siren in a last-ditch attempt to save her marriage.", 
  "boring math professor gregory larkin comes completely unhinged by any thought of sex. he sets out to build a relationship with homely literature professor rose morgan based on a more intellectual level. they marry, but she misses the sex. while he is away on a lecture tour, she diets, exercises, and has a makeover, but that still doesn't solve all their problems.", 
  "relationship between two columbia professors with frustrating personal lives for different reasons. jeff bridges searching for an ideal marriage and barbara straisand plays a woman no one finds attractive. problems soon arise after a marriage without sex and get worse when she is transformed from an ugly duckling into a swan through diet, exercise and a make over."
