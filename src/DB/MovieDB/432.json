  "disney animators set pictures to western classical music as leopold stokowski conducts the philadelphia orchestra. \"the sorcerer's apprentice\" features mickey mouse as an aspiring magician who oversteps his limits. \"the rite of spring\" tells the story of evolution, from single-celled animals to the death of the dinosaurs. \"dance of the hours\" is a comic ballet performed by ostriches, hippos, elephants, and alligators. \"night on bald mountain\" and \"ave maria\" set the forces of darkness and light against each other as a devilish revel is interrupted by the coming of a new day.", 
  "an innovative and revolutionary animated classic from walt disney, combining western classical music masterpieces with imaginative visuals, presented with leopold stokowski and the philadelphia orchestra. the eight animation sequences are colorful, impressive, free-flowing, abstract, and often surrealistic pieces. they include the most famous of all, paul dukas's \"the sorcerer's apprentice\" with mickey mouse as the title character battling brooms carrying endless buckets of water. also included are j.s. bach's \"toccata and fugue in d minor\"; tchaikovsky's \"nutcracker suite\"; dinosaurs and volcanoes in stravinsky's \"rite of spring\"; the delightful \"dance of the hours\" by ponchielli with dancing hippos, crocodiles, ostriches, and elephants; and mussorgsky's darkly apocalyptic \"night on bald mountain.\""
