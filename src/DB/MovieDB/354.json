  "it's 1985. junk bonds, michael jackson, cd players, wealth. robby hart lives in his sister's basement and sings in the band at the reception hall. his dreams of being a singer/songwriter are long gone, replaced now by a burning desire to get married. the problem is that no one seems to want to marry him. his fiancee, linda, doesn't show up on their wedding day, and his new friend, julia, is engaged to a wealthy wall street broker. where does billy idol fit into all this?", 
  "robby is stood up at the altar by linda, who decides that the prospect of marrying a guy who sings at wedding receptions doesn't equal the attraction she felt when he was lead singer in a rock band. robby finds consolation in his friendship with julia, a waitress at the wedding receptions and bar mitzvahs where he performs. julia asks robby to help her plan her upcoming wedding to glenn, who isn't interested in the details of the ceremony. robby learns that glenn also isn't totally interested in julia and is marrying her because she \"deserves it\" after sticking with him for years and because he knows she's not marrying him for his money, since she dated him back before he started pulling down the big bucks.", 
  "robbie hart is an extremely talented wedding singer who, ironically, is left standing at the altar on his own wedding day. convinced by his friends to go back to work, robbie befriends julia sullivan, a waitress who works at the reception hall where he sings, and who is about to marry a cheating skunk. as robbie helps julia plan for her wedding, they begin to fall for each other, and robbie realizes that if either of them are ever going to be happy, he's going to have to pull off one heck of a show."
