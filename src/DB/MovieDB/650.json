 "Synopsis": "text is too large - max size is 60,000 characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe night had brought little relief from the heat, and at dawn a hot gust of\nwind blows across the colorless sea. the knight, antonius block, lies\nprostrate on some spruce branches spread over the fine sand. his eyes are wide-open and bloodshot from lack of sleep.\n\nnearby his squire jons is snoring loudly. he has fallen asleep where he collapsed, at the edge of the forest among the wind-gnarled fir trees. his open mouth gapes towards the dawn, and unearthly sounds come from his throat.\nat the sudden gust of wind, the horses stir, stretching their parched muzzles towards the sea. they are as thin and worn as their masters.\n\nthe knight has risen and waded into the shallow water, where he rinses his sunburned face and blistered lips. jons rolls over to face the forest and the darkness. he moans in his sleep and vigorously scratches the stubbled hair on his head. a scar stretches diagonally across his scalp, as white as lightning against the grime.\n\nthe knight returns to the beach and falls on his knees. with his eyes closed and brow furrowed, he says his morning prayers. his hands are clenched together and his lips form the words silently. his face is sad and bitter. he opens his eyes and stares directly into the morning sun which wallows up from the misty sea like some bloated, dying fish. the sky is gray and immobile, a dome of lead. a cloud hangs mute and dark over the western horizon. high up, barely visible, a seagull floats on motionless wings. its cry is weird and restless. the knight's large gray horse lifts its head and whinnies. antonius block turns around.\n\nbehind him stands a man in black. his face is very pale and he keeps his hands hidden in the wide folds of his cloak.\n\nknight who are you?\n\ndeath i am death.\n\nknight have you come for me?\n\ndeath i have been walking by your side for a long time.\n\nknight that i know.\n\ndeath are you prepared?\n\nknight\nmy body is frightened, but i am not.\n\ndeath well, there is no shame in that.\n\nthe knight has risen to his feet. he shivers. death opens his cloak to place it around the knight's shoulders.\n\nknight wait a moment.\n\ndeath that's what they all say. i grant no reprieves.\n\nknight you play chess, don't you?\n\na gleam of interest kindles in death's eyes.\n\ndeath how did you know that?\n\nknight i have seen it in paintings and heard it sung in ballads.\n\ndeath yes, in fact i'm quite a good chess player.\n\nknight but you can't be better than i am.\n\nthe knight rummages in the big black bag which he keeps beside him and takes out a small chessboard. he places it carefully on the ground and begins setting up the pieces.\n\ndeath why do you want to play chess with me?\n\nknight i have my reasons.\n\ndeath that is your privilege.\n\nknight the condition is that i may live as long as i hold out against you. if i win, you will release me. is it agreed?\n\nthe knight holds out his two fists to death, who smiles at him suddenly. death points to one of the knight's hands; it contains a black pawn.\n\nknight you drew black!\n\ndeath very appropriate. don't you think so?\n\nthe knight and death bend over the chessboard. after a moment of hesitation, antonius block opens with his king's pawn. death moves, also using his king's pawn.\n\nthe morning breeze has died down. the restless movement of the sea has ceased, the water is silent. the sun rises from the haze and its glow whitens. the sea gull floats under the dark cloud, frozen in space. the day is already scorchingly hot.\n\nthe squire jons is awakened by a kick in the rear. opening his eyes, he grunts like a pig and yawns broadly. he scrambles to his feet, saddles his horse and picks up the heavy pack.\n\nthe knight slowly rides away from the sea, into the forest near the beach and up towards the road. he pretends not to hear the morning prayers of his squire. jons soon overtakes him.\n\njons (sings)\nbetween a strumpet's legs to lie is the life for which i sigh.\n\nhe stops and looks at his master, but the knight hasn't heard jon's song, or he pretends that he hasn't. to give further vent to his irritation, jons sings even louder.\n\njons (sings)\nup above is god almighty so very far away, but your brother the devil you will meet on every level.\n\njons finally gets the knight's attention. he stops singing. the knight, his horse, jons's own horse and jons himself know all the songs by heart. the long, dusty journey from the holy land hasn't made them any cleaner. they ride across a mossy heath which stretches towards the horizon. beyond it, the sea lies shimmering in the white glitter of the sun.\n\njons in frjestad everyone was talking about evil omens and other horrible things. two horses had eaten each other in the night, and, in the churchyard, graves had been opened and the remains of corpses scattered all over the place. yesterday afternoon there were as many as four suns in the heavens.\nthe knight doesn't answer. close by, a scrawny dog is whining, crawling towards its master, who is sleeping in a sitting position in the blazing hot sun. a black cloud of flies clusters around his head and shoulders. the miserable-looking dog whines incessantly as it lies flat on its stomach, wagging its tail.\n\njons dismounts and approaches the sleeping man. jons addresses him politely. when he doesn't receive an answer, he walks up to the man in order to shake him awake. he bends over the sleeping man's shoulder, but quickly pulls back his hand. the man falls backward on the heath, his face turned towards jons. it is a corpse, staring at jons with empty eye sockets and white teeth.\n\njons remounts and overtakes his master. he takes a drink from his waterskin and hands the bag to the knight.\n\nknight well, did he show you the way?\n\njons not exactly.\n\nknight what did he say?\n\njons nothing.\n\nknight was he a mute?\n\njons no, sir, i wouldn't say that. as a matter of fact, he was quite eloquent.\n\nknight oh?\n\njons he was eloquent, all right. the trouble is that what he had to say was most depressing.\n(sings)\none moment you're bright and lively, the next you're crawling with worms. fate is a terrible villain and you, my friend, its poor victim.\n\nknight must you sing?\n\njons no.\n\nthe knight hands his squire a piece of bread, which keeps him quiet for a while. the sun burns down on them cruelly, and beads of perspiration trickle down their faces. there is a cloud of dust around the horses' hooves. they ride past an inlet and along verdant groves. in the shade of some large trees stands a bulging wagon covered with a mottled canvas. a horse whinnies nearby and is answered by the knight's horse. the two travelers do not stop to rest under the shade of the trees but continue riding until they disappear at the bend of the road.\n\nin his sleep, jof the juggler hears the neighing of his horse and the answer from a distance. he tries to go on sleeping, but it is stifling inside the wagon. the rays of the sun filtering through the canvas cast streaks of light across the face of jof's wife, mia, and their one-year-old son, mikael, who are sleeping deeply and peacefully. near them, jonas skat, an older man, snores loudly.\n\njof crawls out of the wagon. there is still a spot of shade under the big trees. he takes a drink of water, gargles, stretches and talks to his scrawny old horse.\n\njof good morning. have you had breakfast? i can't eat grass, worse luck. can't you teach me how? we're a little hard up. people aren't very interested in juggling in this part of the country.\n\nhe has picked up the juggling balls and slowly begins to toss them. then he stands on his head and cackles like a hen. suddenly he stops and sits down with a look of utter astonishment on his face. the wind causes the trees to sway slightly. the leaves stir and there is a soft murmur. the flowers and the grass bend gracefully, and somewhere a bird raises its voice in a long warble.\n\njof's face breaks into a smile and his eyes fill with tears. with a dazed expression he sits flat on his behind while the grass rustles softly, and bees and butterflies hum around his head. the unseen bird continues to sing.\n\nsuddenly the breeze stops blowing, the bird stops singing, jof's smile fades, the flowers and grass wilt in the heat. the old horse is still walking around grazing and swishing its tail to ward off the flies.\n\njof comes to life. he rushes into the wagon and shakes mia awake.\n\njof mia, wake up. wake up! mia, i've just seen something. i've got to tell you about it!\n\nmia (sits up, terrified)\nwhat is it? what's happened?\n\njof listen, i've had a vision. no, it wasn't a vision. it was real, absolutely real.\n\nmia oh, so you've had a vision again!\n\nmia's voice is filled with gentle irony. jof shakes his head and grabs her by the shoulders.\n\njof but i did see her!\n\nmia whom did you see?\n\njof the virgin mary.\n\nmia can't help being impressed by her husband's fervor. she lowers her voice.\n\nmia did you really see her?\n\njof she was so close to me that i could have touched her. she had a golden crown on her head and wore a blue gown with flowers of gold. she was barefoot and had small brown hands with which she was holding the child and teaching him to walk. and then she saw me watching her and she smiled at me. my eyes filled with tears and when i wiped them away, she had disappeared. and everything became so still in the sky and on the earth. can you understand ...\n\nmia what an imagination you have.\n\njof you don't believe me! but it was real, i tell you, not the kind of reality you see every day, but a different kind.\n\nmia\nperhaps it was the kind of reality you told us about when you saw the devil painting our wagon wheels red, using his tail as a brush.\n\njof (embarrassed)\nwhy must you keep bringing that up?\n\nmia\nand then you discovered that you had red paint under your nails.\n\njof well, perhaps that time i made it up. (eagerly) i did it just so that you would believe in my other visions. the real ones. the ones that i didn't make up.\n\nmia (severely)\nyou have to keep your visions under control.\notherwise people will think that you're a half-wit, which you're not. at least not yet -- as far as i know. but, come to think of it, i'm not so sure about that.\n\njof (angry)\ni didn't ask to have visions. i can't help it if voices speak to me, if the holy virgin appears before me and angels and devils like my company.\n\nskat (sits up)\nhaven't i told you once and for all that i need my morning's sleep! i have asked you politely, pleaded with you, but nothing works. so now i'm telling you to shut up!\n\nhis eyes are popping with rage. he turns over and continues snoring where he left off. mia and jof decide that it would be wisest to leave the wagon. they sit down on a crate. mia has mikael on her knees. he is naked and squirms vigorously. jof sits close to his wife. slumped over, he still looks dazed and astonished. a dry, hot wind blows from the sea.\n\nmia if we would only get some rain. everything is burned to cinders. we won't have anything to eat this winter.\n\njof (yawning)\nwe'll get by.\n\nhe says this smilingly, with a casual air. he stretches and laughs contentedly.\n\nmia i want mikael to have a better life than ours.\n\njof mikael will grow up to be a great acrobat -- or a juggler who can do the one impossible trick.\n\nmia what's that?\n\njof to make one of the balls stand absolutely still\nin the air.\n\nmia but that's impossible.\n\njof impossible for us -- but not for him.\n\nmia you're dreaming again.\n\nshe yawns. the sun, has made her a bit drowsy and she lies down on the grass.\njof does likewise and puts one arm around his wife's shoulders.\n\njof i've composed a song. i made it up during the night when i couldn't sleep. do you want to hear it?\n\nmia sing it. i'm very curious.\njof i have to sit up first.\n\nhe sits with his legs crossed, makes a dramatic gesture with his arms and sings in a loud voice.\n\njof (sings)\non a lily branch a dove is perched against the summer sky, she sings a wondrous song of christ and there's great joy on high.\n\nhe interrupts his singing in order to be complimented by his wife.\n\njof mia! are you asleep?\n\nmia it's a lovely song.\n\njof i haven't finished yet.\nmia i heard it, but i think i'll sleep a little longer. you can sing the rest to me afterwards.\n\njof all you do is sleep.\n\njof is a bit offended and glances over at his son, mikael, but he is also sleeping soundly in the high grass. jonas skat comes out from the wagon. he yawns; he is very tired and in a bad humor. in his hands he holds a crudely made death mask.\n\nskat is this supposed to be a mask for an actor? if the priests didn't pay us so well, i'd say no thank you.\n\njof are you going to play death?\nskat just think, scaring decent folk out of their wits with this kind of nonsense.\n\njof when are we supposed to do this play?\n\nskat at the saints' feast in elsinore. we're going to perform right on the church steps, believe it or not.\njof wouldn't it be better to play something bawdy? people like it better, and, besides, it's more fun.\n\nskat idiot. there's a rumor going around that there's a terrible pestilence in the land, and now the priests are prophesying sudden death and all sorts of spiritual agonies.\n\nmia is awake now and lies contentedly on her back, sucking on a blade of grass and looking smilingly at her husband.\njof and what part am i to play?\n\nskat you're such a damn fool, so you're going to be the soul of man.\n\njof that's a bad part, of course.\n\nskat who makes the decisions around here? who is the\ndirector of this company anyhow?\n\nskat, grinning, holds the mask in front of his face and recites dramatically.\n\nskat bear this in mind, you fool. your life hangs by a thread. your time is short. (in his usual voice) are the women going to like me in this getup? will i make a hit? no! i feel as if i were dead already.\n\nhe stumbles into the wagon muttering furiously. jof sits, leaning forward. mia lies beside him on the grass.\n\nmia jof!\njof what is it?\nmia sit still. don't move.\n\njof what do you mean?\n\nmia don't say anything.\n\njof i'm as silent as a grave.\n\nmia shh! i love you.\n\nwaves of heat envelop the gray stone church in a strange white mist. the knight dismounts and enters. after tying up the horses, jons slowly follows him in. when he comes onto the church porch he stops in surprise. to the right of the entrance there is a large fresco on the wall, not quite finished. perched on a crude scaffolding is a painter wearing a red cap and paint-stained clothes. he has one brush in his mouth, while with another in his hand he outlines a small, terrified human face amidst a sea of other faces.\n\njons what is this supposed to represent?\n\npainter the dance of death.\n\njons and that one is death?\npainter yes, he dances off with all of them.\njons why do you paint such nonsense?\n\npainter i thought it would serve to remind people that they must die.\njons well, it's not going to make them feel any happier.\n\npainter why should one always make people happy? it might not be a bad idea to scare them a little once in a while.\n\njons then they'll close their eyes and refuse to look at your painting.\npainter oh, they'll look. a skull is almost more interesting than a naked woman.\njons if you do scare them ...\n\npainter they'll think.\n\njons and if they think ...\npainter they'll become still more scared.\njons and then they'll run right into the arms of the priests.\n\npainter that's not my business.\njons you're only painting your dance of death.\n\npainter i'm only painting things as they are. everyone else can do as he likes.\n\njons just think how some people will curse you.\n\npainter maybe. but then i'll paint something amusing for them to look at. i have to make a living -- at least until the plague takes me.\njons the plague. that sounds horrible.\n\npainter you should see the boils on a diseased man's throat. you should see how his body shrivels up so that his legs look like knotted strings -- like the man i've painted over there.\n\nthe painter points with his brush. jons sees a small human form writhing in the grass, its eyes turned upwards in a frenzied look of horror and pain.\n\njons that looks terrible.\n\npainter it certainly does. he tries to rip out the boil, he bites his hands, tears his veins open with his fingernails and his screams can be heard everywhere. does that scare you?\njons scare? me? you don't know me. what are the horrors you've painted over there?\n\npainter the remarkable thing is that the poor creatures\nthink the pestilence is the lord's punishment. mobs of people who call themselves slaves of sin are swarming over the country, flagellating themselves and others, all for the glory of god.\n\njons do they really whip themselves?\n\npainter yes, it's a terrible sight. i crawl into a ditch and hide when they pass by.\n\njons do you have any brandy? i've been drinking water all day and it's made me as thirsty as a camel in the desert.\n\npainter i think i frightened you after all.\n\njons sits down with the painter, who produces a jug of brandy.\n\n\n\nthe knight is kneeling before a small altar. it is dark and quiet around him.\nthe air is cool and musty. pictures of saints look down on him with stony eyes. christ's face is turned upwards, his mouth open as if in a cry of anguish. on the ceiling beam there is a representation of a hideous devil spying on a miserable human being. the knight hears a sound from the confession booth and approaches it. the face of death appears behind the grille for an instant, but the knight doesn't see him.\n\nknight i want to talk to you as openly as i can, but my heart is empty.\n\ndeath doesn't answer.\nknight the emptiness is a mirror turned towards my own face. i see myself in it, and i am filled with fear and disgust.\n\ndeath doesn't answer.\nknight through my indifference to my fellow men, i have isolated myself from their company. now i live in a world of phantoms. i am imprisoned in my dreams and fantasies.\n\ndeath and yet you don't want to die.\n\nknight yes, i do.\ndeath what are you waiting for?\n\nknight i want knowledge.\n\ndeath you want guarantees?\n\nknight call it whatever you like. is it so cruelly inconceivable to grasp god with the senses? why should he hide himself in a mist of half-spoken promises and unseen miracles?\n\ndeath doesn't answer.\nknight how can we have faith in those who believe when we can't have faith in ourselves? what is going to happen to those of us who want to believe but aren't able to? and what is to become of those who neither want to nor are capable of believing?\n\nthe knight stops and waits for a reply, but no one speaks or answers him. there is complete silence.\n\nknight why can't i kill god within me? why does he live on in this painful and humiliating way even though i curse him and want to tear him out of my heart? why, in spite of everything, is he a baffling reality that i can't shake off? do you hear me?\n\ndeath yes, i hear you.\n\nknight i want knowledge, not faith, not suppositions, but knowledge. i want god to stretch out his hand towards me, reveal himself and speak to me.\n\ndeath but he remains silent.\nknight\ni call out to him in the dark but no one seems to be there.\ndeath perhaps no one is there.\nknight then life is an outrageous horror. no one can live in the face of death, knowing that all is nothingness.\n\ndeath most people never reflect about either death or the futility of life.\n\nknight but one day they will have to stand at that last moment of life and look towards the darkness.\n\ndeath when that day comes ...\nknight in our fear, we make an image, and that image we call god.\ndeath you are worrying ...\n\nknight death visited me this morning. we are playing chess together. this reprieve gives me the chance to arrange an urgent matter.\n\ndeath what matter is that?\nknight my life has been a futile pursuit, a wandering, a great deal of talk without meaning. i feel no bitterness or self-reproach because the lives of most people are very much like this. but i will use my reprieve for one meaningful deed.\n\ndeath is that why you are playing chess with death?\n\nknight he is a clever opponent, but up to now i haven't lost a single man.\n\ndeath how will you outwit death in your game?\n\nknight i use a combination of the bishop and the knight which he hasn't yet discovered. in the next move i'll shatter one of his flanks.\n\ndeath i'll remember that.\n\ndeath shows his face at the grill of the confession booth for a moment but disappears instantly.\n\nknight you've tricked and cheated me! but we'll meet again, and i'll find a way.\n\ndeath (invisible)\nwe'll meet at the inn, and there we'll continue playing.\n\nthe knight raises his hand and looks at it in the sunlight which comes through the tiny window.\n\nknight this is my hand. i can move it, feel the blood pulsing through it. the sun is still high in the sky and i, antonius block, am playing chess with death.\n\nhe makes a fist of his hand and lifts it to his temple.\n\n\n\nmeanwhile, jons and the painter have got drunk and are talking animatedly together.\n\njons me and my master have been abroad and have just come home. do you understand, you little pictor?\n\npainter the crusade.\n\njons (drunk)\nprecisely. for ten years we sat in the holy land and let snakes bite us, flies sting us, wild animals eat us, heathens butcher us, the wine poison us, the women give us lice, the lice devour us, the fevers rot us, all for the glory of god. our crusade was such madness that only a real idealist could have thought it up. but what you said about the plague was horrible.\n\npainter it's worse than that.\n\njons ah, me. no matter which way you turn, you have your rump behind you. that's the truth.\n\npainter the rump behind you, the rump behind you there's a profound truth.\n\njons paints a small figure which is supposed to represent himself.\n\njons this is squire jns. he grins at death, mocks the lord, laughs at himself and leers at the girls. his world is a jnsworld, believable only to himself, ridiculous to all including himself, meaningless to heaven and of no interest to hell.\n\nthe knight walks by, calls to his squire and goes out into the bright sunshine. jons manages to set himself down from the scaffolding.\n\noutside the church, four soldiers and a monk are in the process of putting a woman in the stocks. her face is pale and child-like, her head has been shaved, and her knuckles are bloody and broken. her eyes are wide open, yet she doesn't appear to be fully conscious.\n\njons and the knight stop and watch in silence. the soldiers are working quickly and skillfully, but they seem frightened and dejected. the monk mumbles from a small book. one of the soldiers picks up a wooden bucket and with his hand begins to smear a bloody paste on the wall of the church and around the woman. jons holds his nose.\n\njons that soup of yours has a hell of a stink. what is it good for?\n\nsoldier she has had carnal intercourse with the evil one.\n\nhe whispers this with a horrified face and continues to splash the sticky mess on the wall.\n\njons and now she's in the stocks.\n\nsoldier she will be burned tomorrow morning at the parish boundary. but we have to keep the devil away from the rest of us.\n\njons (holding his nose)\nand you do that with this stinking mess?\n\nsoldier it's the best remedy: blood mixed with the bile of a big black dog. the devil can't stand the smell.\n\njons neither can i.\njons walks over towards the horses. the knight stands for a few, moments looking at the young girl. she is almost a child. slowly she turns her eyes towards him.\n\nknight have you seen the devil?\n\nthe monk stops reading and raises his head.\n\nmonk you must not talk to her.\n\nknight can that be so dangerous?\n\nmonk i don't know, but she is believed to have caused the pestilence with which we are affected.\n\nknight i understand.\n\nhe nods resignedly and walks away. the young woman starts to moan as though she were having a horrible nightmare. the sound of her cries follows the two riders for a considerable distance down the road.\n\nthe sun stands high in the sky, like a red ball of fire. the waterskin is empty and jons looks for a well where he can fill it.\n\nthey approach a group of peasant cottages at the edge of the forest. jons ties up the horses, slings the skin over his shoulder and walks along the path towards the nearest cottage. as always, his movements are light and almost soundless. the door to the cottage is open. he stops outside, but when no one appears he enters. it is very dark inside and his foot touches a soft object. he looks down. beside the whitewashed fireplace, a woman is lying with her face to the ground.\n\nat the sound of approaching steps, jons quickly hides behind the door. a man comes down a ladder from the loft. he is broad and thick-set. his eyes are black and his face is pale and puffy. his clothes are well cut but dirty and in rags. he carries a cloth sack. looking around, he goes into the inner room, bends over the bed, tucks something into the bag, slinks along the walls, looking on the shelves, finds something else which he tucks in his bag.\n\nslowly he re-enters the outer room, bends over the dead woman and carefully slips a ring from her finger. at that moment a young woman comes through the door. she stops and stares at the stranger.\n\nravel why do you look so surprised? i steal from the dead. these days it's quite a lucrative enterprise.\n\nthe girl makes a movement as if to run away.\n\nravel you're thinking of running to the village and telling. that wouldn't serve any purpose. each of us has to save his own skin. it's as simple as that.\n\ngirl don't touch me.\n\nraval don't try to scream. there's no one around to hear you, neither god nor man.\n\nslowly he closes the door behind the girl. the stuffy room is now in almost total darkness. but jons becomes clearly visible.\n\njons i recognize you, although it's a long time since we met. your name is raval, from the theological college at roskilde. you are dr. mirabilis, coelestis et diabilis.\n\nraval smiles uneasily and looks around.\n\njons am i not right?\n\nthe girl stands immobile.\n\njons you were the one who, ten years ago, convinced my master of the necessity to join a better-\nclass crusade to the holy land.\n\nraval looks around.\njons you look uncomfortable. do you have a stomach-\nache?\n\nraval smiles anxiously.\n\njons when i see you, i suddenly understand the meaning of these ten years, which previously seemed to me such a waste. our life was too good and we were too satisfied with ourselves. the lord wanted to punish us for our complacency. that is why he sent you to spew out your holy venom and poison the knight.\n\nravel i acted in good faith.\n\njons but now you know better, don't you? because now you have turned into a thief. a more fitting and rewarding occupation for scoundrels. isn't that so?\n\nwith a quick movement he knocks the knife out of raval's hand, gives him a kick so that he falls on the floor and is about to finish him off. suddenly the girl screams. jons stops and makes a gesture of generosity with his hand.\njons by all means. i'm not bloodthirsty.\n\nhe bends over raval.\n\nravel don't beat me.\n\njons i don't have the heart to touch you, doctor. but remember this: the next time we meet, i'll brand your face the way one does with thieves. (he rises)\nwhat i really came for is to get my waterskin filled.\n\ngirl we have a deep well with cool, fresh water. come, i'll show you.\n\nthey walk out of the house. raval lies still for a few moments, then he rises slowly and looks around. when no one is in sight, he takes his bag and steals away. jons quenches his thirst and fills his bag with water. the girl helps him.\n\njons jns is my name. i am a pleasant and talkative young man who has never had anything but kind thoughts and has only done beautiful and noble deeds. i'm kindest of all to young women. with them, there is no limit to my kindness.\n\nhe embraces her and tries to kiss her, but she holds herself back. almost immediately he loses interest, hoists the waterbag on his shoulder and pats the girl on the cheek.\n\njons goodbye, my girl. i could very well have raped you, but between you and me, i'm tired of that kind of love. it runs a little dry in the end.\n\nhe laughs kindly and walks away from her. when he has walked a short distance he turns; the girl is still there.\n\njons now that i think of it, i will need a housekeeper. can you prepare good food? (the girl nods)\nas far as i know, i'm still a married man, but\ni have high hopes that my wife is dead by now.\nthat's why i need a housekeeper. (the girl doesn't answer but gets up)\nthe devil with it! come along and don't stand there staring. i've saved your life, so you owe me a great deal.\n\nshe begins walking towards him, her head bent. he doesn't wait for her but walks towards the knight, who patiently awaits his squire.\n\nthe embarrassment inn lies in the eastern section of the province. the plague has not yet reached this area on its way along the coast.\n\nthe actors have placed their wagon under a tree in the yard of the inn. dressed in colorful costumes, they perform a farce.\n\nthe spectators watch the performance, commenting on it noisily. there are\nmerchants with fat, beer-sweaty faces, apprentices and journeymen, farmhands and milkmaids. a whole flock of children perch in the trees around the wagon.\nthe knight and his squire have sat down in the shadow of a wall. they drink beer and doze in the midday heat. the girl from the deserted village sleeps at jons's side. skat beats the drums, jof blows the flute, mia performs a gay and lively dance. they perspire under the hot white sun. when they have finished skat comes forward and bows.\n\nskat noble ladies and gentlemen, i thank you for your interest. please remain standing for a\nlittle longer, or sit on the ground, because we are now going to perform a tragedia about an unfaithful wife, her jealous husband, and the handsome lover -- that's me.\n\nmia and jof have quickly changed costumes and again step out on the stage. they bow, to the public.\n\nskat here is the husband. here is the wife. if you'll shut up over there, you'll see something splendid. as i said, i play the lover and i haven't entered yet. that's why i'm going to hide behind the curtain for the time being. (he wipes the sweat from his forehead)\nit's damned hot. i think we'll have a thunderstorm.\n\nhe places his leg in front of jof as if to trip him, raises mia's skirt, makes a face as if he could see all the wonders of the world underneath it, and disappears behind the gaudily patched curtains.\n\nskat is very handsome, now that he can see himself in the reflection of a tin washbowl. his hair is tightly curled, his eyebrows are beautifully bushy, glittering earrings vie for equal attention with his teeth, and his cheeks are flushed rose red.\nhe sits out in back on the tailboard of the wagon, dangling his legs and whistling to himself.\nin the meantime jof and mia play their tragedy; it is not, however, received with great acclaim. skat suddenly discovers that someone is watching him as he gazes contentedly into the tin bowl. a woman stands there, stately in both height and volume.\nskat frowns, toys with his small dagger and occasionally throws a roguish but fiery glance at the beautiful visitor. she suddenly discovers that one of her shoes doesn't quite fit. she leans down to fix it and in doing so allows her generous bosom to burst out of its prison -- no more than honor and chastity allow, but still enough so that the actor with his experienced eye immediately sees that there are ample rewards to be had here.\n\nnow she comes a little closer, kneels down and opens a bundle containing several dainty morsels and a skin filled with red wine. jonas skat manages not to fall off the wagon in his excitement. standing on the steps of the wagon, he supports himself against a nearby tree, crosses his legs and bows.\nthe woman quietly bites into a chicken leg dripping with fat. at this moment the actor is stricken by a radiant glance full of lustful appetites.\n\nwhen he sees this look, skat makes an instantaneous decision, jumps down from the wagon and kneels in front of the blushing damsel.\n\nshe becomes weak and faint from his nearness, looks at him with a glassy glance and breathes heavily. skat doesn't neglect to press kisses on her small, chubby hands. the sun shines brightly and small birds make noises in the bushes.\n\nnow she is forced to sit back; her legs seem unwilling to support her any longer. bewildered, she singles out another chicken leg from the large sack of food and holds it up in front of skat with an appealing and triumphant expression, as if it were her maidenhood being offered as a prize.\n\nskat hesitates momentarily, but he is still the strategist. he lets the chicken leg fall to the grass, and murmurs in the woman's rosy ear.\n\nhis words seem to please her. she puts her arms around the actor's neck and pulls him to her with such fierceness that both of them lose their balance and tumble down on the soft grass. the small birds take to their wings with frightened shrieks.\n\n\n\njof stands in the hot sun with a flickering lantern in his hand. mia pretends to be asleep on a bench which has been pulled forward on the stage.\n\njof night and moonlight now prevail here sleeps my wife so frail ...\n\nvoice from the public\ndoes she snore?\n\njof may i point out that this is a tragedy, and in tragedies one doesn't snore.\n\nvoice from the public\ni think she should snore anyhow.\n\nthis opinion causes mirth in the audience. jof becomes slightly confused and goes out of character, but mia keeps her head and begins snoring.\n\njof night and moonlight now prevail.\nthere snores -- i mean sleeps -- my wife so frail. jealous i am, as never before, i hide myself behind this door. faithful is she to her lover -- not me. he soon comes a-stealing to awaken her lusty feeling. i shall now kill him dead for cuckolding me in my bed. there he comes in the moonlight, his white legs shining bright. quiet as a mouse, here i'll lie, tell him not that he's about to die.\n\njof hides himself. mia immediately ends her snoring and sits up, looking to the left.\n\nmia look, there he comes in the night my lover, my heart's delight.\n\nshe becomes silent and looks wide-eyed in front of her. the mood in the yard in front of the inn has, up to now, been rather lighthearted despite the heat.\nnow a rapid change occurs. people who had been laughing and chattering fall silent. their faces seem to pale under their sunbrowned skins, the children stop their games and stand with gaping mouths and frightened eyes.\njof steps out in front of the curtain. his painted face bears an expression of horror. mia has risen with mikael in her arms. some of the women in the yard have fallen on their knees, others hide their faces, many begin to mutter half-forgotten prayers.\n\nall have turned their faces towards the white road. now a shrill song is heard. it is frenzied, almost a scream. a crucified christ sways above the hilltop.\n\nthe cross-bearers soon come into sight. they are dominican monks, their hoods pulled down over their faces. more and more of them follow, carrying litters with heavy coffins or clutching holy relics, their hands stretched out spasmodically. the dust wells up around their black hoods; the censers sway and emit a thick, ashen smoke which smells of rancid herbs.\n\nafter the line of monks comes another procession. it is a column of men, boys, old men, women, girls, children. all of them have steel-edged scourges in their hands with which they whip themselves and each other, howling ecstatically. they twist in pain; their eyes bulge wildly; their lips are gnawed to shreds and dripping with foam. they have been seized by madness. they bite their own hands and arms, whip each other in violent, almost rhythmic outbursts. throughout it all the shrill song howls from their bursting throats. many sway and fall, lift themselves up again, support each\nother and help each other to intensify the scourging.\n\nnow the procession pauses at the crossroads in front of the inn. the monks fall on their knees, hiding their faces with clenched hands, arms pressed tightly together. their song never stops. the christ figure on its timbered cross is raised above the heads of the crowd. it is not christ triumphant, but the suffering jesus with the sores, the blood, the hammered nails and the face in convulsive pain. the son of god, nailed on the wood of the cross, suffering scorn and shame.\nthe penitents have now sunk down in the dirt of the road. they collapse where they stood like slaughtered cattle. their screams rise with the song of the monks, through misty clouds of incense, towards the white fire of the sun.\na large square monk rises from his knees and reveals his face, which is red-\nbrown from the sun. his eyes glitter; his voice is thick with impotent scorn.\n\nmonk\ngod has sentenced us to punishment. we shall all perish in the black death. you, standing there like gaping cattle, you who sit there in your glutted complacency, do you know that this may be your last hour? death stands right behind you. i can see how his crown gleams in the sun. his scythe flashes as he raises it above your heads. which one of you shall he strike first? you there, who stand staring like a goat, will your mouth be twisted into the last unfinished gasp before nightfall? and you, woman, who bloom with life and self-\nsatisfaction, will you pale and become extinguished before the morning dawns? you back\nthere, with your swollen nose and stupid grin, do you have another year left to dirty the earth with your refuse? do you know, you insensible fools, that you shall die today or tomorrow, or the next day, because all of you have been sentenced? do you hear what i say? do you hear the word? you have been sentenced, sentenced!\n\nthe monk falls silent, looking around with a bitter face and a cold, scornful\nglance. now, he clenches his hands, straddles the ground and turns his face\nupwards.\n\nmonk\nlord have mercy on us in our humiliation! don't turn your face from us in loathing and contempt, but be merciful to us for the sake of your son, jesus christ.\n\nhe makes the sign of the cross over the crowd and then begins a new song in a\nstrong voice. the monks rise and join in the song. as if driven by some superhuman force, the penitents begin to whip themselves again, still wailing and moaning.\n\nthe procession continues. new members have joined the rear of the column; others who were unable to go on lie weeping in the dust of the road. jons the squire drinks his beer.\n\njons this damned ranting about doom. is that food for the minds of modern people? do they really expect us to take them seriously?\n\nthe knight grins tiredly.\n\njons yes, now you grin at me, my lord. but allow me to point out that i've either read, heard or experienced most of the tales which we people tell each other.\n\nknight (yawns) yes, yes.\njons even the ghost stories about god the father, the angels, jesus christ and the holy ghost --\nall these i've accepted without too much emotion.\n\nhe leans down over the girl as she crouches at his feet and pats her on the head. the knight drinks his beer silently.\n\njons (contentedly)\nmy little stomach is my world, my head is my eternity, and my hands, two wonderful suns. my legs are time's damned pendulums, and my dirty feet are two splendid starting points for my philosophy. everything is worth precisely as much as a belch, the only difference being that a belch is more satisfying.\n\nthe beer mug is empty. sighing, jons gets to his feet. the girl follows him like a shadow.\n\nin the yard he meets a large man with a sooty face and a dark expression. he stops jons with a roar.\n\njons what are you screaming about?\n\nplog i am plog, the smith, and you are the squire jns.\n\njons that's possible.\n\nplog have you seen my wife?\njons no, i haven't. but if i had seen her and she looked like you, i'd quickly forget that i'd seen her.\n\nplog\nwell, in that case you haven't seen her.\n\njons maybe she's run off.\n\nplog do you know anything?\njons i know quite a lot, but not about your wife. go to the inn. maybe they can help you.\n\nthe smith sighs sadly and goes inside.\n\nthe inn is very small and full of people eating and drinking to forget their newly aroused fears of eternity. in the open fireplace a roasting pig turns\non an iron spit. the sun shines outside the casement window, its sharp rays\npiercing the darkness of the room, which is thick with fumes and\nperspiration.\nmerchant\nyes, it's true! the plague is spreading along the west coast. people are dying like flies. usually business would be good at this time of year, but, damn it, i've still got my whole stock unsold.\n\nwoman they speak of the judgment day. and all these omens are terrible. worms, chopped-off hands and other monstrosities began pouring out of an old woman, and down in the village another woman gave birth to a calf's head.\n\nold man the day of judgment. imagine.\n\nfarmer\nit hasn't rained here for a month. we'll surely lose our crops.\n\nmerchant\nand people are acting crazy, i'd say. they flee the country and carry the plague with them wherever they go.\n\nold man the day of judgment. just think, just think!\n\nfarmer if it's as they say, i suppose a person should look after his house and try to enjoy life as long as he can.\n\nwoman but there have been other things too, such things that can't even be spoken of. (whispers)\nthings that mustn't be named -- but the priests say that the woman carries it between her legs and that's why she must cleanse herself.\n\nold man judgment day. and the riders of the apocalypse stand at the bend in the village road. i imagine they'll come on judgment night, at sundown.\n\nwoman there are many who have purged themselves with\nfire and died from it, but the priests say that it's better to die pure than to live for hell.\nmerchant this is the end, yes, it is. no one says it out\nloud, but all of us know that it's the end. and people are going mad from fear.\n\nfarmer\nso you're afraid too.\n\nmerchant\nof course i'm afraid.\n\nold man the judgment day becomes night, and the angels descend and the graves open. it will be terrible to see.\n\nthey whisper in low tones and sit close to each other.\n\n\n\nplog, the smith, shoves his way into a place next to jof, who is still dressed in his costume. opposite him sits raval, leaning slightly forward, his face perspiring heavily. raval rolls an armlet out on the table.\n\nraval do you want this armlet? you can have it cheap.\n\njof i can't afford it.\n\nraval it's real silver.\n\njof it's nice. but it's surely too expensive for me.\n\nplog excuse me, but has anyone here seen my wife?\n\njof has she disappeared?\n\nplog they say she's run away.\n\njof has she deserted you?\n\nplog with an actor.\n\njof an actor! if she's got such bad taste, then i think you should let her go.\n\nplog you're right. my first thought, of course, was to kill her.\n\njof oh. but to murder her, that's a terrible thing to do.\n\nplog i'm also going to kill the actor.\n\njof the actor?\n\nplog of course, the one she eloped with.\n\njof what has he done to deserve that?\n\nplog are you stupid?\njof the actor! now i understand. there are too many of them, so even if he hasn't done anything in particular you ought to kill him merely because he's an actor.\n\nplog you see, my wife has always been interested in the tricks of the theatre.\n\njof and that turned out to be her misfortune.\n\nplog her misfortune, but not mine, because a person who's born unfortunate can hardly suffer from any further misfortune. isn't that true?\n\nnow raval enters the discussion. he is slightly drunk and his voice is shrill and evil.\nraval listen, you! you sit there and lie to the smith.\n\njof i! a liar!\nraval you're an actor too and it's probably your partner who's run off with plog's old lady.\n\nplog are you an actor too?\n\njof an actor! me! i wouldn't quite call myself that!\n\nraval we ought to kill you; it's only logical.\n\njof (laughs)\nyou're really funny.\n\nraval how strange -- you've turned pale. have you anything on your conscience?\n\njof you're funny. don't you think he's funny? (to plog)\noh, you don't.\n\nraval maybe we should mark you up a little with a knife, like they do petty scoundrels of your kind.\n\nplog bangs his hands down on the table so that the dishes jump. he gets up.\nplog (shouting)\nwhat have you done with my wife?\n\nthe room becomes silent. jof looks around, but there is no exit, no way to escape. he puts his hands on the table. suddenly a knife flashes through the air and sinks into the table top between his fingers.\n\njof snatches away his hands and raises his head. he looks half surprised, as if the truth had just become apparent to him.\njof do you want to hurt me? why? have i provoked someone, or got in the way? i'll leave right now and never come back.\n\njof looks from one face to another, but no one seems ready to help him or come to his defense.\nraval get up so everyone can hear you. talk louder.\n\ntrembling, jof rises. he opens his mouth as if to say something, but not a word comes out.\nraval stand on your head so that we can see how good an actor you are.\n\njof gets up on the table and stands on his head. a hand pushes him forward so\nthat he collapses on the floor. plog rises, pulls him to his feet with one hand.\n\nplog (shouts) what have you done with my wife?\n\nplog beats him so furiously that jof flies across the table. raval leans over\nhim.\nraval don't lie there moaning. get up and dance.\n\njof i don't want to. i can't.\n\nravel show us how you imitate a bear.\n\njof i can't play a bear.\n\nraval let's see if you can't after all.\n\nraval prods jof lightly with the knife point. jof gets up with cold sweat on his cheeks and forehead, frightened half to death. he begins to jump and hop on top of the tables, swinging his arms and legs and making grotesque faces.\nsome laugh, but most of the people sit silently. jof gasps as if his lungs were about to burst. he sinks to his knees, and someone pours beer over him.\n\nravel up again! be a good bear.\n\njof i haven't done any harm. i haven't got the strength to play a bear any more.\n\nat that moment the door opens and jons enters. jof sees his chance and steals\nout. raval intends to follow him, but suddenly stops. jons and raval look at each other.\n\njons do you remember what i was going to do to you if we met again?\n\nraval steps back without speaking.\n\njons i'm a man who keeps his word.\n\njons raises his knife and cuts raval from forehead to cheek. raval staggers towards the wall.\n\nthe hot day has become night. singing and howling can be heard from the inn. in a hollow near the forest, the light still lingers. hidden in the grass and\nthe shrubbery, nightingales sing and their voices echo through the stillness.\nthe players' wagon stands in a small ravine, and not far away the horse grazes on the dry grass. mia has sat down in front of the wagon with her son in her arms. they play together and laugh happily.\n\nnow, a soft gleam of light strokes the hilltops, a last reflection from the red clouds over the sea.\n\nnot far from the wagon, the knight sits crouched over his chess game. he lifts his head.\n\nthe evening light moves across the heavy wagon wheels, across the woman and the child. the knight gets up.\n\nmia sees him and smiles. she holds up her struggling son, as if to amuse the knight.\n\nknight what's his name?\n\nmia mikael.\n\nknight how old is he?\n\nmia oh, he'll soon be two.\n\nknight he's big for his age.\n\nmia do you think so? yes, i guess he's rather big.\n\nshe puts the child down on the ground and half rises to shake out her red skirt. when she sits down again, the knight steps closer.\n\nknight you played some kind of show this afternoon.\n\nmia did you think it was bad?\n\nknight you are more beautiful now without your face painted, and this gown is more becoming.\n\nmia you see, jonas skat has run off and left us, so we're in real trouble now.\n\nknight is that your husband?\n\nmia (laughs)\njonas! the other man is my husband. his name is jof.\nknight oh, that one.\n\nmia and now there's only him and me. we'll have to start doing tricks again and that's more trouble than it's worth.\n\nknight do you do tricks also?\n\nmia we certainly do. and jof is a very skillful juggler.\n\nknight is mikael going to be an acrobat?\n\nmia jof wants him to be.\n\nknight but you don't.\n\nmia i don't know.\n(smiling)\nperhaps he'll become a knight.\n\nknight let me assure you, that's no pleasure either.\n\nmia no, you don't look so happy.\n\nknight no.\n\nmia are you tired?\n\nknight yes.\n\nmia why?\nknight i have dull company.\n\nmia do you mean your squire?\n\nknight no, not him.\n\nmia who do you mean, then?\n\nknight myself.\n\nmia i understand.\n\nknight do you, really?\nmia yes, i understand rather well. i have often wondered why people torture themselves as often as they can. isn't that so?\n\nshe nods energetically and the knight smiles seriously. now the shrieks and the noise from the inn become louder. black figures flicker across the grass mound. someone collapses, gets up and runs. it is jof. mia stretches out her arms and receives him. he holds his hands in front of his face, moaning like a child, and his body sways. he kneels. mia holds him close to her and sprinkles him with small, anxious questions: what have you done? how are you?\nwhat is it? does it hurt? what can i do? have they been cruel to you? she runs for a rag, which she dips in water, and carefully bathes her husband's\ndirty, bloody face.\neventually a rather sorrowful visage emerges. blood runs from a bruise on his forehead and his nose, and a tooth has been loosened, but otherwise jof seems unhurt.\n\njof ouch, it hurts.\n\nmia\nwhy did you have to go there? and of course you drank.\n\nmia's anxiety has been replaced by a mild anger. she pats him a little harder than necessary.\n\njof ouch! i didn't drink anything.\n\nmia\nthen i suppose you were boasting about the angels and devils you consort with. people don't like someone who has too many ideas and fantasies.\n\njof i swear to you that i didn't say a word about angels.\n\nmia\nyou were, of course, busy singing and dancing. you can never stop being an actor. people also become angry at that, and you know it.\n\njof doesn't answer but searches for the armlet. he holds it up in front of mia with an injured expression.\n\njof look what i bought for you.\n\nmia you couldn't afford it.\n\njof (angry)\nbut i got it anyhow.\n\nthe armlet glitters faintly in the twilight. mia now pulls it across her wrist. they look at it in silence, and their faces soften. they look at each other, touch each other's hands. jof puts his head against mia's shoulder and sighs.\n\njof oh, how they beat me.\n\nmia why didn't you beat them back?\n\njof i only become frightened and angry. i never get a chance to hit back. i can get angry, you know that. i roared like a lion.\n\nmia\nwere they frightened?\n\njof no, they just laughed.\n\ntheir son mikael crawls over to them. jof lies down on the ground and pulls his son on top of him. mia gets down on her hands and knees and playfully sniffs at mikael.\n\nmia do you notice how good he smells?\n\njof and he is so compact to hold. you're a sturdy one. a real acrobat's body.\n\nhe lifts mikael up and holds him by the legs. mia looks up suddenly, remembering the knight's presence.\n\nmia yes, this is my husband, jof.\n\njof good evening.\n\nknight good evening.\njof becomes a little embarrassed and rises. all three of them look at one another silently.\nknight i have just told your wife that you have a splendid son. he'll bring great joy to you.\n\njof yes, he's fine.\nthey become silent again.\njof have we nothing to offer the knight, mia?\n\nknight thank you, i don't want anything.\n\nmia (housewifely)\ni picked a basket of wild strawberries this afternoon. and we have a drop of milk fresh from a cow ...\n\njof ... that we were allowed to milk. so, if you would like to partake of this humble fare, it would be a great honor.\n\nmia please be seated and i'll bring the food.\n\nthey sit down. mia disappears with mikael.\n\nknight where are you going next?\n\njof up to the saints' feast at elsinore.\n\nknight i wouldn't advise you to go there.\n\njof why not, if i may ask?\n\nknight the plague has spread in that direction, following the coast line south. it's said that people are dying by the tens of thousands.\n\njof really! well, sometimes life is a little hard.\n\nknight may i suggest ... (jof looks at him, surprised)\n... that you follow me through the forest tonight and stay at my home if you like. or go along the east coast. you'll probably be safer there.\n\nmia has returned with a bowl of wild strawberries and the milk, places it between them and gives each of them a spoon.\n\njof i wish you good appetite.\n\nknight i humbly thank you.\n\nmia these are wild strawberries from the forest. i have never seen such large ones. they grow up there on the hillside. notice how they smell!\n\nshe points with a spoon and smiles. the knight nods, as if he were pondering some profound thought. jof eats heartily.\n\njof your suggestion is good, but i must think it over.\n\nmia it might be wise to have company going through the forest. it's said to be full of trolls and ghosts and bandits. that's what i've heard.\n\njof (staunchly)\nyes, i'd say that it's not a bad idea, but i have to think about it. now that skat has left, i am responsible for the troupe. after all, i have become director of the whole company.\n\nmia (mimics) after all, i have become director of the whole company.\n\njons comes walking slowly down the hill, closely followed by the girl. mia points with her spoon.\n\nmia do you want some strawberries?\n\njof this man saved my life. sit down, my friend, and let us be together.\n\nmia (stretches herself) oh, how nice this is.\n\nknight for a short while.\nmia nearly always. one day is like another. there is nothing strange about that. the summer, of course, is better than the winter, because in summer you don't have to be cold. but spring is best of all.\n\njof i have written a poem about the spring. perhaps you'd like to hear it. i'll run and get my lyre.\n\nhe sprints towards the wagon.\nmia not now, jof. our guests may not be amused by your songs.\n\njons (politely) by all means. i write little songs myself. for example, i know a very funny song about a wanton fish which i doubt that you've heard yet.\n\nthe knight looks at him.\n\njons you'll not get to hear it either. there are persons here who don't appreciate my art and i don't want to upset anyone. i'm a sensitive soul.\n\njof has come out with his lyre, sits on a small, gaudy box and plucks at the instrument, humming quietly, searching for his melody. jons yawns and lies down.\n\nknight people are troubled by so much.\n\nmia it's always better when one is two. have you no one of your own?\n\nknight yes, i think i had someone.\n\nmia and what is she doing now?\n\nknight i don't know.\n\nmia you look so solemn. was she your beloved?\n\nknight we were newly married and we played together. we laughed a great deal. i wrote songs to her eyes, to her nose, to her beautiful little ears. we went hunting together and at night we danced. the house was full of life ...\n\nmia do you want some more strawberries?\n\nknight (shakes his head)\nfaith is a torment, did you know that? it is like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call.\n\nmia i don't understand what you mean.\n\nknight everything i've said seems meaningless and unreal while i sit here with you and your husband. how unimportant it all becomes suddenly.\n\nhe takes the bowl of milk in his hand and drinks deeply from it several times. then he carefully puts it down and looks up, smiling.\n\nmia now you don't look so solemn.\n\nknight i shall remember this moment. the silence, the twilight, the bowls of strawberries and milk,\nyour faces in the evening light. mikael sleeping, jof with his lyre. i'll try to remember what we have talked about. i'll carry this memory between my hands as carefully as if it were a bowl filled to the brim with fresh milk.\n\nhe turns his face away and looks out towards the sea and the colorless gray sky.\n\nknight and it will be an adequate sign -- it will be enough for me.\n\nhe rises, nods to the others and walks down towards the forest. jof continues to play on his lyre. mia stretches out on the grass.\n\nthe knight picks up his chess game and carries it towards the beach. it is quiet and deserted; the sea is still.\n\ndeath i have been waiting for you.\n\nknight pardon me. i was detained for a few moments. because i revealed my tactics to you, i'm in retreat. it's your move.\n\ndeath why do you look so satisfied?\n\nknight that's my secret.\ndeath of course. now i take your knight.\n\nknight you did the right thing.\n\ndeath have you tricked me?\nknight of course. you fell right in the trap. check!\n\ndeath what are you laughing at?\n\nknight don't worry about my laughter; save your king instead.\n\ndeath you're rather arrogant.\n\nknight our game amuses me.\n\ndeath it's your move. hurry up. i'm a little pressed for time.\n\nknight i understand that you've a lot to do, but you can't get out of our game. it takes time.\n\ndeath is about to answer him but stops and leans over the board. the knight smiles.\n\ndeath are you going to escort the juggler and his wife through the forest? those whose names are jof and mia and who have a small son?\n\nknight why do you ask?\n\ndeath oh, no reason at all.\nthe knight suddenly stops smiling. death looks at him scornfully.\n\nimmediately after sundown, the little company gathers in the yard of the inn.\nthere is the knight, jons and the girl, jof and mia in their wagon. their son, mikael, is already asleep. jonas skat is still missing.\n\njons goes into the inn to get provisions for the night journey and to have a last mug of beer. the inn is now empty and quiet except for a few farmhands and maidens who are eating their evening meal in a corner. at one of the small windows sits a lonely, hunched-over fellow, with a jug of brandy in his hands. his expression is very sad. once in a while he is shaken by a gigantic sob. it is plog, the smith, who sits there and whimpers.\n\njons god in heaven, isn't this plog, the smith?\n\nplog good evening.\n\njons are you sitting here sniveling in loneliness?\n\nplog yes, yes, look at the smith. he moans like a rabbit.\n\njons if i were in your boots, i'd be happy to get rid of a wife in such an easy way.\n\njons pats the smith on the back, quenches his thirst with beer, and sits down by his side.\n\nplog are you married?\njons i! a hundred times and more. i can't keep count of all my wives any longer. but it's often that way when you're a traveling man.\n\nplog i can assure you that one wife is worse than a hundred, or else i've had worse luck than any poor wretch in this miserable world, which isn't impossible.\n\njons yes, it's hell with women and hell without them. so, however you look at it, it's still best to kill them off while it's most amusing.\nplog women's nagging, the shrieking of children and wet diapers, sharp nails and sharp words, blows and pokes, and the devil's aunt for a mother-in-law. and then, when one wants to sleep after a long day, there's a new song -- tears, whining and moans loud enough to wake the dead.\n\njons nods delightedly. he has drunk deeply and talks with an old woman's voice.\n\njons why don't you kiss me good night?\n\nplog (in the same way)\nwhy don't you sing a song for me?\n\njons why don't you love me the way you did when we first met?\n\nplog why don't you look at my new slip?\n\njons you only turn your back and snore.\n\nplog oh hell!\njons oh hell. and now she's gone. rejoice!\nplog (furious) i'll snip their noses with pliers, i'll bash in their chests with a small hammer, i'll tap their heads ever so lightly with a sledge.\n\nplog begins to cry loudly and his whole body sways in an enormous attack of sorrow. jons looks at him with interest.\n\njons\nlook how he howls again.\n\nplog maybe i love her.\n\njons so, maybe you love her! then, you poor misguided ham shank, i'll tell you that love is another word for lust, plus lust, plus lust and a damn lot of cheating, falseness, lies and all kinds of other fooling around.\n\nplog\nyes, but it hurts anyway.\n\njons of course. love is the blackest of all plagues, and if one could die of it, there would be some pleasure in love. but you almost always get over it.\n\nplog\nno, no, not me.\n\njons yes, you too. there are only a couple of poor wretches who die of love once in a while. love is as contagious as a cold in the nose. it eats away at your strength, your independence, your morale, if you have any. if everything is imperfect in this imperfect world, love is most perfect in its perfect imperfection.\n\nplog you're happy, you with your oily words, and, besides, you believe your own drivel.\n\njons believe! who said that i believed it? but i love to give good advice. if you ask me for advice you'll get two pieces for the price of one,",
