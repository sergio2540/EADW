 "Synopsis": "george and nina seem like the perfect couple. they share a cozy brooklyn apartment, a taste for tuna casserole dinners, and a devotion to ballroom dancing. they love each other. there's only one hitch: george is gay. and when nina announces she's pregnant, things get especially complicated. vince - nina's overbearing boyfriend and the baby's father-wants marriage. nina wants independence. george will do anything for a little unqualified affection, but is he ready to become an unwed surrogate dad? by the end of the movie, the meaning of \"extended family\" gets a real workout, and some relational clich\u00e9s get spouted, but the final\u00e9 brings things together in relatively agreeable - if unorthodox - fashion.",
