 "Synopsis": "comments by actor / writer roy c. peterson\n\nthis a very good movie with jean claude van damme as the hero triumphing against all odds. van damme also directed and did a very fine job. it's like a synthesis of indiana jones with bloodsport. the story is set in the 1930s and the tournament is not the kumite, but an equivalent called the ghang-gheng. the script is actually based upon an amended version of the bloodsport story which never got produced. the pageantry here is greater. really exotic settings with a more spectacular tournament venue. more diverse ethnicity via costume. i don't know enough about any of this to comment upon authenticity. for some reason i enjoyed this movie much more the second time i saw it.",
