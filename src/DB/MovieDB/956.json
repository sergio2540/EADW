 "Synopsis": "nobody's fool brings another a startlingly fresh performance from long-established star, paul newman. here, he is \"sully sullivan\" a hard-hitting individualist. sully has earned the grudging friendship of everyone in his small town except for his disaffected grown son. the son, peter, is dylan walsh and he is a creature of suppressed animal magnetism. as a kid, his father seems to have have been a smart-mouthed, playful rascal who, somehow, has managed to preserve himself and the kernel of his youth in the gruff and spirited ways of his adult life. the townspeople engage with sully in hard-edged affection and at protective personal distance. except that peter, the son, feared his hardscrabble father and grew up merely isolated and resentful of his father's taunting ways. the movie's line is that sully has another chance to learn about parenting through his son's young son. giving us the tensions, robert benton's screenplay, from the novel by richard russo, manages to bind a lot of dry humor and insight to the defensive banter of sully and the town's characters. \"nobody's fool\" is a sleeper among films and is thrillingly cast. bruce willis is the town's only other character able to relate directly to newman's \"sully\". jessica tandy is a watchful landlady to sully and the acting legend to whom this film has, rightly, been dedicated. melanie griffith flashes sully's libido with her amazing screen presence. the supporting characters in nobody's fool are ripe, endearing and under-appreciated people: the town lawyer, the town banker and the abiding best friend(s). philip seymour hoffman slaps the audience into heightened alert, as town cop. the \"nobody's fool\" snapshot of sully's small town never winds down the liveliness of its characters. it has the telling differences that signify movie, not sitcom.",
