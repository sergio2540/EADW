 "Synopsis": "dante hicks (brian o'halloran) is a clerk at the quick stop, a local convenience store in leonardo, new jersey. on dante's day off, his boss calls him in to cover a few hours for another employee who is sick. arriving at the store, he finds that padlocks for the security shutters are jammed closed with chewing gum, so he hangs a sheet over them with a message in shoe polish: i assure you; we're open.\n\ndante's day is spent in the purgatory of serving a succession of customers while bemoaning the fact that \"i'm not even supposed to be here today!\" his earliest customer is a man who tries to convince customers buying cigarettes that they should choose chewing gum, chewlies brand, instead of smoking. to emphasize his point, the man shows a customer what he claims is a diseased lung that he carries in a bag. before long, a crowd has gathered at the checkout and turns hostile at the first customer's taunts and rantings, blaming dante for the ills of smoking because he sells cigarettes. when they start pelting him with cigarettes, dante's girlfriend, veronica, sprays them all with a fire extinguisher, bringing them under control. she confronts the man who recommended the chewing gum, finding out he's a representative of the chewlies brand trying to drum up sales. she orders him out along with the mob.\n\ndante and veronica also gets into a fight over her past when she tells him that she performed fellatio on 36 other guys before she dated dante. veronica leaves following a heated argument.\n\ninterspersed with the demands of his job, dante passes time in wide-ranging conversations with his slacker friend, randal graves (jeff anderson). randal ostensibly works at the neighboring rsi video store right next door, although he spends almost the entire day at the quick stop and is not averse to treating customers with contempt.the two converse about many things to pass time, such as if the independent contractors working on the second death star when it was destroyed at the end of return of the jedi were innocent victims or not.\n\nveronica also stops in again and she and dante talk about dante's current disposition in a rut with no motivation to change. further contributing to dante's misery is an announcement in the local newspaper that his unfaithful ex-girlfriend, caitlin, is engaged to be married. for the previous several weeks dante had been secretly talking to caitlin on the phone, rekindling their relationship. dante also talks to randal about how caitlin had frequently been unfaithful to dante, once even mistaking him for another man at a party they'd both gone to separately.\n\nlearning that he's stuck working the store all day because his relief skipped out to go to vermont on vacation and the owner of the store and building is nowhere to be found, dante convinces his friends to play hockey on the store roof. the game is short; 12 minutes into the 1st period, an irate customer climbs up on the roof, knocks dante over in the face off and shoots their only ball off the roof and into a storm drain.\n\nreopening the store, dante finds out one of his ex-girlfriends has died and her memorial service is today. randal talks him into closing the store again and going to the wake. the visit is disastrous, although the audience doesn't see what transpires during the memorial service. however, a later conversation between the two reveals that randal knocked over the casket.\n\nthat evening caitlin (lisa spoonhauer) surprises dante with a visit. after she assures dante that the engagement announcement was premature and arranged by her overbearing and domineering mother, the two trade banter and dante becomes torn between her and veronica. he finally decides to take caitlin on a date and slips home to change. he returns to discover that caitlin had sex with a dead man in the bathroom, having mistaken the man for dante (the man had earlier entered the bathroom with a pornographic magazine and had suffered a fatal heart attack while masturbating). an ambulance takes caitlin away in shock, along with the corpse.\n\nmeanwhile, jay and silent bob (jason mewes and kevin smith), are pair of stoners who've spent all day hanging out (and dealing cannabis) outside the quick stop, enter the store to shoplift. dante turns down jay's offer to party with them. knowing dante's predicament, silent bob pauses before following jay outside and offers the following wisdom: \"you know, there's a million fine-looking women in the world, dude. but they don't all bring you lasagna at work. most of 'em just cheat on you.\"\n\ndante then realizes that he loves veronica. when she returns to the quick stop, though, randal complicates things by revealing that dante was in love with caitlin and is planning to date his ex again. veronica angrily breaks up with dante and reveals to him that randal told her of his plans to be with caitlin. dante finally loses his temper and fights with randal, making a mess of the store. while they sit in the mess they created, dante continues to bemoan his station in life and being stuck in a dead end job, having a girlfriend who had sex with a dead man, and that veronica had an active sex life before she and dante began dating. finally losing his own temper, randall yells back at dante and counters everything by telling dante that he's sick of hearing him whine about how rotten his life is and that dante needs to think about making serious changes in his life if he wants it to improve.\n\nthe film ends with the two reconciling and cleaning up the store for the night. randal \"rangles\" out, popping back in briefly to toss dante's sign at him stating, \"you're closed!\"",
