  "british couple fiona and nigel dobson are sailing to istanbul en route to india. they encounter a beautiful french woman, and that night nigel meets her while dancing alone in the ship's bar. later he meets her crippled american husband oscar, who tells him their story. while living in paris for several years trying to be a writer, he becomes obsessed with a woman he met by chance on a bus. he tracks her down and they start a steamy love affair. soon oscar finds himself enslaved body and soul by her love, and continues to tell nigel the details of this relationship in various stages over a number of visits to oscar's cabin.", 
  "nigel dobson is an english perfect gentleman, married to equally respectable fiona. on a cruise heading for india, they meet a highly unconventional couple, american unpublished would-be literary celebrity oscar, in a wheelchair, and his much younger parisian wife, mimi. oscar insists to tell his unsettling life story to nigel, who is too polite to refuse although its gore content, shamelessly explicit details and foul yankee language rather disgust the well-bred brit, yet becomes also fascinated. oscar tells how he found by chance in mimi a willing partner for sex, ever pushing their boundaries. when he tires of spiraling passionate devotion to her, the tables turn: mimi begs oscar to stay with her at any price, and gets what she bargained for, sadistic scorn and abuse till she's a mere shadow of her former self, yet is finally abandoned on a flight to martinique. later oscar has a car accident, and mimi returns to paris to make sure he is condemned to a wheelchair for life, this time utterly dependent on her, no longer free to choose accepting her abuse, yet they get married. meanwhile fiona tires of waiting for nigel during oscar's story sessions and spends time with flirtatious italian dado. during the new year's eve party, things come to a surprisingly real and personal closure, not in the least for nigel..."
