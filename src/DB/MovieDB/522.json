  "dj zack and pimp jack end up in prison for being too laid-back to avoid being framed for crimes they didn't commit. they end up sharing a cell with eccentric italian optimist roberto, whose limited command of the english language is both entertaining and infuriating -but rather more useful to them is the fact that roberto knows an escape route",
