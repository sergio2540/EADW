  "what do an elderly topiary gardener, a retired lion tamer, a man fascinated by mole rats, and a cutting-edge robotics designer have in common? both nothing and everything in this unconventional documentary directed by erroll morris. fast, cheap & out of control (referring to the robot specialist's strange philosophy of robot design structure, not erroll morris's documentary techniques!) interplays, overlaps, and interrelates these four separate and highly specialized documentary subjects in order to in truth study all of humanity, raising questions about the future of mankind."
