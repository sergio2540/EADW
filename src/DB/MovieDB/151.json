 "Plot": [
  "the world is astounded when willy wonka, for years a recluse in his factory, announces that five lucky people will be given a tour of the factory, shown all the secrets of his amazing candy, and one will win a lifetime supply of wonka chocolate. nobody wants the prize more than young charlie, but as his family is so poor that buying even one bar of chocolate is a treat, buying enough bars to find one of the five golden tickets is unlikely in the extreme. but in movieland, magic can happen. charlie, along with four somewhat odious other children, get the chance of a lifetime and a tour of the factory. along the way, mild disasters befall each of the odious children, but can charlie beat the odds and grab the brass ring?", 
  "adolescent charlie bucket is a good, hard working boy. his washerwoman mother is barely able to eke out a living to support charlie and charlie's bedridden grandparents grandma georgina, grandpa george, grandma josephine, and grandpa joe, the latter to whom charlie has a special bond. they live in the town where the mysterious, reclusive and genius willy wonka runs his chocolate factory. wonka has not been seen in years as he closed his factory to public access after his competitors, most specifically arthur slugworth, infiltrated the factory to steal his candy secrets. however, wonka is once again opening his factory, but only to five people and a guest apiece, each who will be given a lifetime supply of chocolate. those five will be those that find one of the five golden tickets hidden inside wonka chocolate bars. although charlie's chances of getting a golden ticket are remote at best - especially against a glutton, a spoiled peanut heiress, a gum fanatic and a television fanatic - charlie wants it more than anyone else and is the small dream which is keeping his spirit alive. those that eventually get the golden tickets will be exposed to all of wonka's magical secrets, the latest rumored to be that of the everlasting gobstopper, a candy that never gets smaller. but they will also be treated to an experience that some will hopefully learn from. and one will learn the real reason for wonka providing access to the factory. but if five are allowed access, others may also try to gain access, such as a devious slugworth, who will be ruined if the gobstopper hits the markets before he finds out its secret.",
