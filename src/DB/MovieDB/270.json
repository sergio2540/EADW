 "Plot": [
  "in the not-too-distant future, a less-than-perfect man wants to travel to the stars. society has categorized vincent freeman as less than suitable given his genetic make-up and he has become one of the underclass of humans that are only useful for menial jobs. to move ahead, he assumes the identity of jerome morrow, a perfect genetic specimen who is a paraplegic as a result of a car accident. with professional advice, vincent learns to deceive dna and urine sample testing. just when he is finally scheduled for a space mission, his program director is killed and the police begin an investigation, jeopardizing his secret.", 
  "gattaca corp. is an aerospace firm in the future. during this time society analyzes your dna and determines where you belong in life. ethan hawke's character was born with a congenital heart condition which would cast him out of getting a chance to travel in space. so in turn he assumes the identity of an athlete who has genes that would allow him to achieve his dream of space travel.", 
  "vincent is one of the last \"natural\" babies born into a sterile, genetically-enhanced world, where life expectancy and disease likelihood are ascertained at birth. myopic and due to die at 30, he has no chance of a career in a society that now discriminates against your genes, instead of your gender, race or religion. going underground, he assumes the identity of jerome, crippled in an accident, and achieves prominence in the gattaca corporation, where he is selected for his lifelong desire: a manned mission to saturn's 14th moon (titan). constantly passing gene tests by diligently using samples of jerome's hair, skin, blood and urine, his now-perfect world is thrown into increasing desperation, his dream within reach, when the mission director is killed - and he carelessly loses an eyelash at the scene! certain that they know the murderer's id, but unable to track down the former vincent, the police start to close in, with extra searches, and new gene tests. with the once-in-a-lifetime launch only days away, vincent must avoid arousing suspicion, while passing the tests, evading the police, and not knowing whom he can trust..."

 "Synopsis": "in \"the not-too-distant\" future, where genetic engineering of humans is common and dna plays the primary role in determining social class, vincent (ethan hawke) is conceived and born without the aid of this technology. suffering from the nearly eradicated physical dysfunctions of myopia and a congenital heart defect, as well as being given a life expectancy of 30.2 years, vincent faces extreme genetic discrimination and prejudice. the only way he can achieve his life-long dream of becoming an astronaut is to break the law and impersonate a \"valid\", a person with appropriate genetic advantage.[4]\n\nhe assumes the identity of jerome eugene morrow (jude law), a former swimming star who, despite a genetic profile \"second to none\", won only a silver medal in a high-profile competition. he then attempted to commit suicide by jumping in front of a car, but again fell short of his goal in that he only succeeded in paralyzing himself from the waist down. however, as the incident occurred outside the country, no one knows of his newly acquired disability. thus, vincent can \"buy\" his identity with no one the wiser. though he requires orthopedic surgery to increase his height, persistant practice to favor his right hand instead of his left, and contact lenses to replace his glasses while matching jerome's eyes, he can use his \"valid\" dna in blood, tissue and urine samples to pass any genetic test - as long as he takes extreme measures to leave no traces of his identity as an \"in-valid\". but, where he was once an object of scorn and pity, he is now a perpetrator of an unspeakable fraud. legally, exposure would only subject him to fines, but socially the consequences would be far more extreme - he is now a heretic against the new order of genetic determinism. vincent is now a \"borrowed ladder\" (a reference to the ladder structure of an un-coiled dna strand) or in harsher language, a de-gene-erate.\n\nwith jerome's impressive genetic profile he easily gains access to the gattaca aerospace corporation (his interview consists entirely of a urine test), the most prestigious space-flight conglomerate of the day. with his own equally impressive determination, he quickly becomes the company's ace celestial navigator. but a week before vincent is scheduled to leave for saturn's moon titan, the mission director is murdered, and evidence of vincent's own \"in-valid\" dna is found in the building in the form of an eyelash. the presence of this unexpected dna attracts the attention of the police, and vincent must evade ever-increasing security as his mission launch date approaches and he pursues a relationship with his co-worker irene cassini (uma thurman).\n\nafter numerous close calls, the investigation eventually comes to a close as director josef (adam s. gottbetter) is arrested for the murder by the lead detective covering the investigation (alan arkin). the director reveals that he murdered the mission director in order to buy time for the mission to launch, because the window of opportunity for the launch is only open once every seventy years, and that it is now too late to stop the launch. however, just as vincent appears to be in the clear, he is confronted by one of the detectives, who is revealed as vincent's estranged brother, anton (loren dean). anton tries to convince vincent to go with him for protection before vincent is found out. however, it soon becomes apparent that anton is acting more out of insecurity and is more concerned with how vincent had managed to get the better of him, despite his supposed genetic superiority. vincent and anton settle their competition as they did when they were children, by seeing who could swim out into the ocean farthest. as he did once before when they were young, vincent manages to beat his brother, and, once again, saves him from drowning. this is simply because he refused to save any strength to swim back - he is willing to risk everything to succeed. conversely his brother worried about preserving enough strength to swim out and return again, and these fears kept him from testing his true limits.\n\nanton: \"vincent! how are you doing this, vincent? how have you done any of this? we have to go back!\"\n\nvincent: \"it's too late for that, we're closer to the other side.\"\n\nanton: \"what other side? do you want to drown us both\"\n\nvincent: \"you want to know how i did it? this is how i did it, anton. i never saved anything for the swim back.\"\n\nas the day of the launch finally arrives, jerome bids vincent farewell and says that he intends to travel too. he reveals that he has stored enough genetic samples to last vincent two lifetimes. overwhelmed and grateful, vincent thanks jerome for \"lending\" him the identity that has allowed his success at gattaca. jerome replies, however, that it is he who should be grateful, since vincent lent jerome his dreams. as vincent moves through the gattaca complex to the launch site, he is stopped for an unexpected dna test. vincent reluctantly agrees to take the test, even though he has none of jerome's genetic material to hide his identity. the test result uncovers vincent's \"in-valid\" status, and the doctor, lamar (adam s. gottbetter), reveals that he has known vincent's true identity all along, saying: \"for future reference, right-handed men don't hold it with their left. just one of those things\". lamar then alters the test result to allow him to proceed regardless, confessing that his son admires vincent, and wants to be an astronaut just like him, despite an unforeseen genetic defect that would already rule him out. as the shuttle lifts off, jerome is shown committing suicide inside his home incinerator, wearing his silver medal, which turns gold in the flames.\n\nthe story centers on the irony of the perfect jerome failing to succeed despite being given every advantage while the imperfect vincent transcends his deficiencies through force of will and spirit. a milder version of the disorder that afflicts vincent prevents irene from taking part in space flight. this dichotomy shows how the eugenic policy in gattaca and the world in which it is set adversely affect the humanity of both vincent and jerome, as well as the \"invalid\" and \"valid\" humans they represent. a coda, cut from the final film, lists various people who have succeeded despite genetic deficiencies (and would be excluded in the modern society of gattaca), such as albert einstein and abraham lincoln.\n\n",
