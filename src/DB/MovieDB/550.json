 "Plot": [
  "john mcclane is now almost a full-blown alcoholic and is suspended from the nypd. but when a bomb goes off in the bonwit teller department store the police go insane trying to figure out what's going on. soon, a man named simon calls and asks for mcclane. simon tells inspector walter cobb that mcclane is going to play a game called \"simon says\". he says that mcclane is going to do the tasks he assigns him. if not, he'll blow off another bomb. with the help of a harlem electrician, john mcclane must race all over new york trying to figure out the frustrating puzzles that the crafty terrorist gives him. but when a bomb goes off in a subway station right by the federal reserve (the biggest gold storage in the world) things start to get heated up.", 
  "john mcclane, officer of the nypd and hero of both the nakatomi hostage crisis and the dulles international airport crisis, must join forces with a harlem shop owner to prevent simon, brother of the late hans gruber and serial bomber, from stealing billions of dollars worth of gold from the federal reserve building in new york city.", 
  "a man calling himself \"simon\" begins a reign of terror in the streets of new york: he threatens to detonate bombs around the city unless detective john mcclane cooperates in a game of \"simon says\". mcclane has a bad hangover and a bad attitude, and isn't in the mood for games, especially this one.", 
  "it's a quiet morning in new york city...until a massive bomb explodes in the bonwit teller department store, causing several vehicles to flip, and causing several drivers to come to a sudden stop. this throws the nypd into a frenzy, trying to sort out what's going on. at the station, inspector walter cobb of the nypd's major case unit gets a call from a man who calls himself simon. simon asks for lieutenant john mcclane, and walter tells simon that john, who is now an alcoholic, is on suspension. simon wants john to go to the corner of 138th street and amsterdam in harlem and wear a racist sign. walter and his fellow officers joe lambert, connie kowalski, and ricky walsh find john, who is now an alcoholic who is seperated from his wife holly, and they talk to him. ricky tells walter that there have been 3 killings in the red hook section of brooklyn in the past two nights, and 14 dump trucks were stolen from a construction yard on staten island. john wants to know where the backup is going to be, and walter tells him that the backup will be on 128th street, 10 blocks away. john complains that 10 blocks is too far away for the backup to be. walter tells john that simon has threatened to detonate another bomb if the police don't do what he says. john wants to know why he's been targeted by simon, but no one knows why. while john is in harlem, store owner zeus carver rescues john from a black street gang that was beating john up because of the sign. john and zeus find themselves stuck with each other as simon continues his antics and forces john and zeus to work together to do what he tells them, but john and zeus can't stop one of simon's bombs from blowing up a subway station, and it turns out that simon is simon peter gruber the brother of hans gruber, the terrorist that john rescued the nakatomi building from in los angeles years ago. the question now is, is this about revenge on john, or is simon planning something a lot bigger?"

 "Synopsis": "when a bomb explodes at the bonwit teller department store, a man calling himself \"simon\" phones major case unit inspector walter cobb at the police station and claims responsibility for the bomb. he orders suspended police officer lt. john mcclane to walk through the middle of harlem, in his underwear, wearing a sandwich board with the slogan \"i hate niggers\" on it. mcclane is driven there by cobb and three other officers. harlem electrician zeus carver spots mcclane and tries to get him off the street before he is killed, but a gang of black youths attacks mcclane and carver, who barely escape. returning to the station, mcclane and carver learn that simon is likely in possession of several gallons of a bio-chemical agent explosive stolen the night before. simon calls the station again and demands mcclane and carver put themselves through a series of \"games\" to prevent any more explosions. mcclane is forced to lie to carver to gain his trust.\none of simon's games require mcclane and carver to travel to the wall street subway station, over 70 blocks away, within 30 minutes to stop a bomb on it. though mcclane manages to get aboard the train, identify the bomb, and throw it off the train car, simon still ignites the bomb, ravaging much of the station but without any fatalities thanks to mcclane and carver. the two are met by fbi agents that have identified simon as simon \"peter\" gruber, the brother of hans gruber, who was killed by mcclane in the first film, and several of his cohorts. during the debriefing, simon calls into the group and warns that another bomb has been planted in one of new york's city schools, and that any police radio could set it off. as mcclane and carver are forced to complete more games to identify the school, the police organize a massive search of every school, forcing the teams to rely on telephone communications.\nmcclane, while playing at simon's games, realizes that something is wrong and returns to wall street while carver continues to follow simon's instructions. mcclane finds simon's men have raided the federal reserve bank through the ruined subway system, making off with $140 billion of gold bullion from the vault, hauling it away in dump trucks. mcclane attempts to follow the dump trucks through the aqueduct, but simon destroys a cofferdam and floods the tunnel; mcclane escapes and regroups with carver. they continue to follow the dump trucks to a tanker, and make a daring attempt to board it, but are quickly caught. at the same time that the police attempt to evacuate the school they think the bomb is in, mcclane and carver find that simon has instead used the rest of the explosive to rig the tanker to explode, which would send the gold to the bottom of the sea. after simon leaves, mcclane and carver escape the doomed tanker just before the bomb is detonated.\nas they regroup with the police and have their wounds tended to, mcclane reveals that there was no gold on the ship, as it was replaced with scrap metal, and simon has likely gotten away. carver prompts mcclane to call his estranged wife holly, but while on line with her, discovers that an aspirin bottle given to him by simon identifies a nearby border town in quebec. mcclane leads a raid along with the royal canadian mounted police on a warehouse where simon and his men have started to distribute the gold. simon attempts to escape on a helicopter and shoot down mcclane, but mcclane is able to fire upon a power line, severing it onto the helicopter and destroying it. carver joins mcclane and convinces him to finish his call to holly at a nearby pay phone.",
