 "Synopsis": "bill capa (bruce willis) is a psychoanalyst who becomes rather disturbed himself when an angry patient holds him at gunpoint before committing suicide by jumping from his office window high in a building (compare that to the fall at the beginning of vertigo which precipitates the phobia in the james stewart character).\n\nthe sight of the bloody body of his patient, clad in a bright green dress, causes capa to suffer, bizarrely, from stress-induced color blindness. the title refers to the fact that he sees only shades of gray.\n\nto restart his hectic life, capa travels to los angeles, california, to stay with a friend, fellow therapist dr. bob moore. when moore is murdered capa is plunged into the mystery of his friend's death. moore would gather his patients every monday for a group discussion of their problems and police detective lt. hector martinez suspects one of them of being the killer.\n\ncapa also conducts an affair with rose (jane march), a mysterious girl who comes and goes without warning into his life. as their relationships progress, capa learns of his patients' past and obsessions:\n\nclark suffers from obsessive compulsive disorder and insists on cleanliness and counting things; he beat up his wife; sondra (lesley ann warren) has had many affairs and is a kleptomaniac; she stabbed her father with a knife and fork and one of her husbands died of unnatural causes; buck is an unsociable ex-cop; his wife and daughter were brutally murdered and the case is unsolved; casey is the arrogant son of a wealthy man and paints sado-masochist paintings; he burnt down his father's house; richie is a sixteen-year-old with a stutter and a gender identity problem, wanting to be a woman rather than a man; he has a record for drugs. then, one of the patients turns up dead, and capa himself is the subject of several attempts on his life. he soon discovers that all his patients have been involved with rose and this leads to a twist ending...\n\n",
