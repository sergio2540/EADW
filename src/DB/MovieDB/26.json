  "this angst-filled tale of three irish-catholic brothers explores men's relationships with women. three different situations are set up on parallel plotlines, with each brother facing a different kind of crisis. their common bond as family, as well as close lifelong friends, allows them to express their feelings frankly and intimately, as they talk and discuss their concerns among each other. jack finds himself in a marriage gone stale and under pressure to start a family that he does not yet feel ready for. barry, dedicated to his film career and almost pathologically averse to any type of commitment in a relationship, is suddenly artistically successful and finds true love, both for the first time and both pulling him in opposite directions. patrick is torn between his love for his religion and ethnic heritage and his love for susan, his longtime jewish girlfriend. ultimately, they are all asked to resist temptation of one sort or another, with various poignant outcomes.",

 "Synopsis": "the film begins with finbar \"barry\" mcmullen (edward burns) standing at the grave of his recently deceased father, along with his mother, who tells him that she's returning to her native ireland to be with finbar o'shaughnessy (after whom barry is named), her sweetheart of long ago. she tells barry that while she gave barry's father 35 of the best years of her life, she's going to start living life her way with the man she really loves. while this could be interpreted as disrespect for the memory of the family patriarch, it is later revealed in the movie that he was an alcoholic and abused his family prior to his death.\n\nflashing forward five years later, barry's older brother jack (jack mulcahy) has purchased their parents' long island home and lives in it with his wife molly (connie britton), who is pressing jack to start a family due to irish tradition, despite his reluctance. the truth is, jack is torn between his love for molly and his lust for ann (elizabeth makay), a former romantic interest of barry's. jack begins an affair with ann behind molly's back.\n\nmeanwhile, barry and the youngest brother, pat (mike mcglone) ask to temporarily move in with jack, to which he reluctantly agrees. pat and barry, like their brother, are basically overgrown teenagers torn between prolonged adolescence and commitment to marriage. pat plans to break his engagement to susan (shari albert), but becomes depressed when she breaks up with him, citing his indecisiveness about their relationship and the problems that could come between two faiths, as susan is jewish and pat is a devout irish catholic.\n\nbarry shows no interest in a long-term relationship, until he meets audrey (maxine bahns), a woman whom he accuses of \"stealing\" an apartment that he was trying to rent for himself. though things do not go well between them at first, they warm up to one another and start a relationship.\n\nmolly learns of jack's affair after finding a wrapped condom in his pants as she is cleaning up after him one day. she confronts jack, but he refuses to discuss it. his brothers also try to intervene, but to no avail as he tells them, that by catholic tradition, no one can intervene in a married couple's disputes.\n\nafter much pleading, susan decides to take pat back. but almost immediately after she does so, pat decides to end the relationship for good. the reason is leslie, a girl-next-door type who likes to work on her father's car... a sharp contrast to susan's materialistic personality; leslie offers pat nothing more than simple friendship. the friendship develops into something a little more when they decide to head out to california together in a classic car that leslie has her eye on.\n\njack, knowing he has to make a choice between his wife and his mistress, finally breaks it off for good with ann, despite his repeated attempts to do so in the past. hurt by the rejection that she's heard many times before from jack, ann tells him to never call her again. he then returns home determined to rebuild his wounded marriage, but not before paying a visit to his father's grave, promising (in a voice-over) that he will be a better husband to his wife than his father was, pouring a bottle of irish whiskey over the grave.\n\nbarry decides to move in with audrey and take their relationship to the next level. the movie ends with all three brothers gathering at the family homestead with a newfound belief in love and a desire to not let the ghosts of the past stand in their way.",
