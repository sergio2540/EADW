  "chronicles the six-month strike at hormel in austin, minnesota, in 1985-86. the local union, p-9 of the food and commercial workers, overwhelmingly rejects a contract offer with a $2/hour wage cut. they strike and hire a new york consultant to manage a national media campaign against hormel. despite support from p-9's rank and file, fcwu's international disagrees with the strategy. in addition to union-company tension, there's union-union in-fighting. hormel holds firm; scabs, replacement workers, brothers on opposite sides, a union coup d'\u00e9tat, and a new contract materialize. the film asks, was it worth it, or was the strike a long-term disaster for organized labor?"
