 "Synopsis": "george thomason (tom georgeson) and his right-hand man, ken pile (michael palin), a beleaguered animal lover with a bad stutter, plan a jewel heist and bring in two americans to help: an alluring con artist, wanda gershwitz (jamie lee curtis) and a \"weapons man\", otto west (kevin kline). wanda and otto are lovers pretending to be siblings so that wanda can work her charms on george and ken. wanda and otto plan to betray ken and george after the heist, and vice-versa. wanda, it later transpires, is also planning to betray otto.\n\nafter the robbery, wanda and otto betray george to the police, intending to take all the loot for themselves, but discover that george and ken have moved the loot to a new location. wanda decides to seduce george's unhappily married lawyer, archie leach (john cleese) to find out where it is. meanwhile, ken is charged by george to silence a key witness, and otto exerts his energies in fits of jealousy over wanda and archie and of impatience with ken and britain in general. otto's interference, and other incidences of bad luck, lead wanda and archie's liaisons to go disastrously wrong.\n\nthere is subsequent confusion and slapstick. for example, in various attempts to kill the witness, the animal-loving ken accidentally instead kills her three yorkshire terriers one by one. the witness eventually suffers a fatal heart attack when her third terrier is killed. the title is derived from the name of ken's favorite tropical fish, which otto eats alive, to ken's distress, during the farcical torture scene.\n\narchie and wanda gradually fall in love and the movie ends with those two leaving the country with the jewels. ken finally has his revenge on otto by running him over with a steamroller (which he somehow survives). title cards at the end of the movie reveal their futures: \"archie and wanda were married in rio, had seventeen children, and founded a leper colony. ken became master of ceremonies at the london sea world. otto emigrated to south africa and became minister for justice.",
