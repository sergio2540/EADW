  "a town of blaine, missouri is preparing for celebrations of its 150th anniversary. corky st.clair, an off-off-off-off-off-broadway director is putting together an amateur theater show about the town's history, starring a local dentist, a couple of travel agents, a dairy queen waitress, and a car repairman. he invites a broadway theater critic mr. guffman to see the opening night of the show.", 
  "the residents of blaine, missouri - the self-proclaimed home of the first ufo landing in the united states (blaine residents beg to differ with roswell's claims) and stool capital of the world - are excited about the town's upcoming sesquicentennial celebrations, which will have as its centerpiece the original musical production, \"red, white and blaine\". assisted by high school music teacher lloyd miller, corky st. clair, the musical's writer/composer and former new york theater professional (off off off off broadway) who currently leads the blaine community players, will helm the production. corky and lloyd are excited about their 'talented' cast of locals and the production as a whole, corky and lloyd who themselves are as untalented and unaware as their cast. corky and company are especially anticipating the presence of mort guffman in the audience on opening night, he a representative of the prestigious new york based oppenheimer organization. in corky's mind, a favorable review from guffman means that the production is heading to broadway. through all the ups and downs and more downs of the pre-production, everyone in blaine still can't wait for opening night and the arrival of guffman, upon who the cast and crew's dreams rest."
