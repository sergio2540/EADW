 "Synopsis": "this synopsis is too short and may not include the required detailed description of the entire plot. we normally require that synopses be at least 10 lines long.\nif you have seen this title, please help us by improving and expanding this synopsis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nby appearing first in a bathrobe, vick the gangster boss, is aping the headlines of that era. we were seeing a mafia chieftain in new york city appearing for his court appearances in a bathrobe, trying to cop a plea by appearing insane.\nrichard dreyfuss and a herd of aging actors make this a fascinating study for what happens when actors go over the hill. the exception to the rule is ellen barkin, playing a sexy, really hot gangster's moll to jeff goldblum's professional hitman. with the name of holliday, jeff gives us a great clue to the action as murder draw-downs follow murder draw-downs. definitely a quixotic movie with no moral, whatsoever but fun to see.",
