 "Synopsis": "los angeles:\nas evening falls, sassy tomboy cabby corky (winona ryder) picks up hot-shot hollywood executive victoria snelling (gena rowlands) from the airport, and as corky drives, victoria tries to conduct business over the phone. despite their extreme differences socially, the two develop a certain connection. sometime during the ride victoria, who is evidently a talent scout or casting director, discovers that corky would be ideal for a part in a movie she is casting, but corky rejects the offer, as she has plans to become a mechanic.\n\nnew york:\nhelmut grokenberger (armin mueller-stahl), a mild east german immigrant who was once a clown in his home country, now works in new york as a taxi driver. he picks up a passenger named yoyo (giancarlo esposito), a brash, streetwise young man and attempts to drive him to brooklyn. helmut doesn't really know how to drive with an automatic transmission so he allows yoyo to drive. on their way, they pick up yoyo's argumentative sister-in-law angela (rosie perez). the story revolves around helmut's attempts to understand and become a part of the culture of new york.\n\nparis:\na blind woman (b\u00e9atrice dalle) goes for a ride at night with a driver (isaach de bankol\u00e9) who hails from the ivory coast. they both take some verbal jabs at each other during the ride. the driver asks his passenger what it's like to be blind and she attempts to explain to him, but their cultural differences and differences of life experience make things difficult. an ironic twist at the end of the segment turns upon a french pun near the beginning of it: when the driver states his nationality as \"ivoirien,\" some other africans mock him with the punning phrase \"y voit rien\" (he sees nothing there). after he drops off his blind passenger, he feels fascinated by her and gazes in her direction. this inattention to driving causes him to crash into another car, whose driver angrily accuses him of being blind.\n\nrome:\nin the wee morning hours, a very eccentric cabbie (roberto benigni) picks up a priest (paolo bonacelli). as he drives, he starts to confess his sins. much to priest's discomfort, he goes into great detail about how he discovered his sexuality first with a pumpkin and then with a sheep, then details a love affair he had with his brother's wife. the already-ailing priest is shocked by the lurid confession, and promptly has a fatal heart attack, leaving the cabbie with a very troubling situation.\n\nhelsinki:\nafter an evening spent drinking heavily, three workers, one of whom has just been laid off (kari v\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen, sakari kuosmanen, and tomi salmela), climb into a cab to return home. on the way to drop them off the workers talk about what an awful fix their now-unconscious friend is in, by being out of work and having to face a divorce and a pregnant daughter. the driver mika (matti pellonp\u00e4\u00e4) then tells them all the saddest story they have ever heard. the workers are terribly moved and depressed by the story, and even become unsympathetic toward their drunken, laid-off companion. as they arrive home, the sun is beginning to rise on a new day. but no one sees change in their stupering friend from his day to day life.",
