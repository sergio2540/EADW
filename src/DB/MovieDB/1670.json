 "Synopsis": "a man walks into a grocery store and notices another man looking at\nthe red meat in the display case. man 1 follows man 2, knocks him out,\nbinds his eyes and mouth with duct tape, chains him to the top of his car,\ndrains a quart of his blood into a bottle, drives a stake through his\nheart, and dumps the body into his trunk.\n\nmeanwhile, ryan [greg james] and j.t. [sean farley], best friends since grade school, have\ntickets to see bladerunner after the closing of the video store where\nthey work. the only problem is that j.t.'s car is in the shop, ryan\ndoesn't drive, and their driving buddy mike just broke his leg, so they\nask the new guy alex [dusan cechvala] whether he'd be able to give them a lift. no\nproblem...until alex's radiator begins to overheat and the car stalls.\nthey walk back a few blocks to a gas station, but it's closing and the\nattendant refuses to sell them any antifreeze. alex suggests that they\nmight get help from his ex-girlfriend adia [tina kapousis], who lives a few blocks away.\nwhile walking there, however, they are attacked by two punks, one of whom\nstabs alex in the stomach. as the punk gloats and ryan and j.t. fear for\ntheir lives, alex suddenly rises up and kills both punks by biting them in\nthe necks. it is thus that ryan and j.t. discover that alex is a vampire.\n\nso is adia. she's also an alcoholic, and she has taken up with a new\nguy, a vampire named slain [jason bouwer], who works in a blood bank and who brings\n\"dinner\" every night. slain is not there, so adia loans slain's car to alex.\nwhile they drive to an open gas station to get antifreeze, the trunk on\nslain's car comes loose. alex stops the car to close it and finds in the\ntrunk a body and an icechest of blood. worse yet, the stake through the\nbody's heart tells alex that it belongs to a vampire. furthermore, the\nblood in the bottles, all marked by blood type, is vampire blood (alex can\ntell by the smell). it appears that the vampire slain is killing other\nvampires for their blood. but why?\n\nmore important at the moment is the fact that slain is living with\nadia, a vampire vampire-killer living with a vampire, so alex hurriedly\ntelephones adia and warns her to get out of the house. unfortunately,\nslain has already come home and, knowing that adia has loaned out his car,\nrewards her with a stake through the heart. alex arrives and tries to\nrevive adia, but it's too late. as alex is rifling through adia's room,\nlooking for information about slain, he comes upon a list of names -- four\nvampires, three of whom are dead, and their blood types. only marcus thoel\nremains.\n\nassuming that marcus thoel is slain's next target, the boys go\nlooking for him. first stop is the local vamp bar (\"bram stoker's\n'cheers!'\") where alex visits with clyde [ eric jaan], the gay vampire who turned him.\nclyde has not heard of slain, but he is able to provide marcus' address.\nwhen they arrive at marcus' house, however, they find that slain has\nalready been there. marcus is dead. even worse, he was tortured before he\nwas staked. alex concludes that it was marcus who turned slain and that\nthis killing was done out of revenge as much as for marcus' type o blood.\nsuddenly, it all fits together in alex's mind. slain is a new vampire who\nis in pain because of being turned, so he is collecting blood from\nvampires in order to contaminate the blood at the blood bank and turn all\nrecipients into vampires so that they can also feel his pain, just like an\naids victim who goes around giving the virus to others.\n\nafter figuring out at which blood bank slain works, the boys head\nover. they get there just as slain is tainting human blood with drops of\nvampire blood. big fight in which alex succeeds in staking slain. slain's\nlast words: \"thank you.\" since it's only a little after 1 am, the boys\nhead off to the theater.
