  "(sirius 6b, year 2078) on a distant mining planet ravaged by a decade of war, scientists have created the perfect weapon: a blade-wielding, self-replicating race of killing devices known as screamers designed for one purpose only -- to hunt down and destroy all enemy life forms but man's greatest weapon has continued to evolve without any human guidance, and now it has devised a new mission: to obliterate all life. col. hendricksson (peter weller) is commander of a handful of alliance soldiers still alive on sirius 6b. betrayed by his own political leaders and disgusted by the atrocities of this never-ending war, hendricksson decides he must negotiate a separate peace with the new economic bloc's decimated forces. but to do so, he will have to cross a treacherous wasteland where the deadliest threat comes from the very weapons he helped to create."
