 "Plot": [
  "beautiful, detached, laconic, consumptive lily brest is a streetwalker with few clients. she loves her idle boyfriend raoul who gambles away what little she earns. the town's power broker, called the rich jew, discovers she is a good listener, so she's soon busy. raoul imagines grotesque sex scenes between lily and the jew; he leaves her for a man. her parents, a bitter fascist who is a cabaret singer in drag and her wheelchair-bound mother, offer no refuge. even though all have a philosophical bent, the other whores reject lily because she tolerates everyone, including men. she tires of her lonely life and looks for a way out. even that act serves the local corrupt powers."
