  "a rebel knight from king arthur's round table seeks to expand his empire by force, and terrorises the subjects of guinevere, who has received an offer of marriage from arthur. on the way to visit arthur she has a chance meeing with the free-spirited and bohemian lancelot, to whom she finds herself attracted.", 
  "merlin, excalibur and all things supernatural are out of this picture, as king arthur, aged and war-weary is forced to go to battle one last time against the traitor prince malagant, whilst in the meantime his new bride guinevere and new knight sir lancelot betray the king in their own way."
