  "politics are already strained between english imperialists and the west african government of kinjanja, when womanizing british diplomat morgan leafy (colin friels) is caught in bed with celia (joanne whalley-kilmer), wife of corrupt kinjanjan presidential candidate sam adekunle (academy award winner louis gossett jr.). as punishment, leafy is forced into bribing an official who has voted down a project that stands to make adekunle very rich. leafy thinks he's gotten off easy until he learns the lone holdout is none other than kinjanja's own brick wall of integrity, dr. alex murray (connery). meanwhile, leafy must also contend with his absurdly stuffy boss fanshawe (john lithgow), fanshawe's lusty wife (diana rigg) and their luscious, too friendly daughter!"
