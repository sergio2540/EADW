 "Synopsis": "warning: this movie is extraordinarily susceptible to being spoiled.\nit is very similar to citizen kane in this regard. please consider\nnot reading past the 15th paragraph (there will be a warning) until\nyou have seen the movie.\n\nimmortal beloved is a biographical account of ludwig van beethoven's\n(gary oldman) life and loves, in the form of a fictionalized treatment\nof an enigmatic letter to his \"immortal beloved\" that was found after\nhis death. (the letter, the mystery about the addressee's identity,\nand a great many other aspects of beethoven's life, are treated\nreasonably authentically in the movie. but the identity of the\n\"immortal beloved\" indicated in the movie should be regarded as\nfictional.)\n\nthe movie is structured like citizen kane---a mystery is revealed upon\nbeethoven's death, and the movie is a long series of flashbacks\nthrough beethoven's life as his secretary and confidant anton\nschindler (jeroen krabb\u00e9) scours the countryside attempting to solve\nthe matter. the mystery is the discovery of an unofficial will\nfound among beethoven's papers upon his death, bequeathing all\nhis property to an unnamed \"immortal beloved\", along with a passionate\nlove letter to her. schindler vows to find out who she was, and thus\ncarry out beethoven's last wish, keenly aware of how society had\nfailed beethoven throughout his life. he is opposed in this by\nbeethoven's surviving brother johann (gerard horan) and johann's wife\ntherese (alexandra pigg), who feel that the estate should be theirs,\nbased on an earlier official will, and as compensation for the abuse\nthey endured from ludwig.\n\nschindler (anton schindler really was beethoven's secretary and\nassistant, and apparently really was as sycophantic in real life as\nhis depiction in the movie) sets out for the hotel in karlsbad where\nthe letter was sent. during this journey, a voice-over recites part\nof the letter, while the slow 2nd movement of beethoven's 5th\n(\"emperor\") piano concerto plays. the letter explains his ardent love\nfor this woman, while explaining that he has been delayed, by a\nserious coach breakdown, from seeing her.\n\nthe proprietress, frau streicher (miriam margolyes), tells him that\nbeethoven had indeed come there many years before to stay with a woman\nwho had checked in earlier. this woman did not give her name, and\ncovered herself in a veil at all times. a letter from beethoven\narrived, and she took it to the room, along with a meal, after opening\nit to find out what room it should go to---\"immortal beloved\" was not\nan adequate address. the woman apparently did not like the letter,\nbecause she checked out shortly thereafter. then beethoven arrived,\nsaw that the woman had left, and went on a rampage, destroying\nfurniture and breaking a window. an extensive search of the hotel's\npast registry books yields the page on which the woman signed in, but\nthe name is illegible. frau streicher lets schindler tear out the page\nand take it with him.\n\nschindler then goes to see various women who were known to have been\npersonally involved with beethoven, beginning with giulietta\nguicciardi (valeria golino). she tells schindler of her fascination\nwith beethoven, her desire to marry him, and his rather eccentric and\nboorish behavior. because beethoven was rumored to be extremely shy\nabout performing on the piano (the real reason was his approaching\ndeafness) she arranges to have a very new and expensive piano brought\nto the house, and she tells beethoven that everyone will be away and\nhe can try it out. he does so, playing the moonlight sonata while his\nhead is pressed against the top of the piano so that he can hear it as\nwell as possible. giulietta, along with her father\n(luigi diberti), have been hiding an an adjacent room. she is so\nmoved by his playing that she comes out of hiding, walks up to\nbeethoven without his seeing her, and touches him. beethoven recoils\nin horror, shouting \"it is terrible to rob me in this way of my most\ntreasured feelings\". it soon becomes clear to giulietta and her\nfather that beethoven is deaf. shortly afterwards, giulietta married\ncount gallenburg, another composer.\n\nschindler returns to vienna and runs into ludwig's brother johann, who\nreminds him that ludwig cared only for himself, and wanted to control\nother people to keep them serving him. as a case in point, when the\nthird brother caspar (christopher fulford) (who had died earlier) was\nto marry johanna reiss (johanna ter steege), ludwig expressed his\nstrong disdain for the union, making extremely crude statements: \"by\nall means, copulate with her. but marriage? every farmhand in the\nregion has enjoyed her for free. why should you pay more?\" just\nafter the marriage, ludwig sends the police to their apartment,\nconfronting them in bed and commanding the police to \"arrest that\nwhore\". caspar shows the marriage license, and also explains that\njohanna is pregnant. ludwig becomes bitterly estranged from caspar\nand johanna for years after that. johann explains to schindler that\nludwig was just as strongly opposed to his own marriage to therese,\nand just as abusive to them.\n\nschindler's travels then take him to hungary for a meeting with\ncountess anna marie erdody (isabella rossellini), who fills in a lot more\nof the history. she had been present during the disastrous premiere\nof the emperor concerto, in which beethoven's deafness made him unable\nto keep the orchestra together, and hence the world first truly\nlearned of his malady. anna took him in at her palace, and they lived\ntogether for a few years. she said that those were probably the\nhappiest years of both of their lives, that she loved him, but that\nbeethoven did not seem to truly love her. these years included the\nhorrifying siege of vienna by napoleon's troops, during which one of\nanna's three children was killed.\n\nschindler himself takes up the flashback narrative at this point,\ncontinuing his conversation with countess erdody. he describes how\nhe, as a budding violinist, first met beethoven at a rehearsal of the\n\"kreutzer\" sonata. and how beethoven explained his ideas of the\nmeaning of music, and that this particular piece is about a person\ntrying to reach his lover by coach, but the coach broke down in\nbad weather, causing great despair. schindler did not realize at the\ntime that this was what would be described in the \"immortal beloved\"\nletter.\n\nduring this period, beethoven became convinced that his brother caspar\nhad taken some of his manuscripts, and went to confront him. they\nhadn't spoken in 8 years, and things started off well, until ludwig\nstarted forcibly going through caspar's papers, and also referring to\njohanna as \"this foul slut you call a wife.\" a violent fight ensues,\nto the horror of schindler, johanna, and their 8-year-old son karl\n(matthew north). when ludwig leaves, caspar is profusely coughing\nup blood, and in fact dies a few months later. at the interment,\nludwig remarks to shindler that johanna seems to be seeing another man\nalready. \"my brother's bed is not yet cold and he is climbing in.\"\n\nludwig then takes legal action against johanna, to take custody of\nkarl, on the grounds that she is of low moral character. just before\nthe police take karl away, johanna tells karl not to believe anything\nthat ludwig says about her; it is all lies.\n\nkarl stays with ludwig, who plans to make karl into a great pianist.\nludwig relates to karl that his own father had tried, unssuccessfully,\nto do the same with him, to make him the new mozart. after ludwig had\nfailed at this, the flashback shows his father administering a brutal\nthrashing, and strongly suggesting that ludwig's hearing loss had been\ncaused by this.\n\na further legal battle ensues because ludwig suspects that johanna is\nbribing people to allow her to visit karl in secret. there is a highly\npublic trial, and beethoven even bribes metternich (barry humphries),\nby promising to write an oratorio for him, a promise that he never\nkept. metternich intercedes on beethoven's behalf, and he wins the case.\n\nbeethoven's squalid living style and generally disagreeable character\nare depicted at length. karl, a young adult at this point\n(marco hofschneider), had been scheduled by ludwig to give a public\npiano recital, and he tells schindler that he is \"at the end of his\ntether.\" he knows that he is a very mediocre pianist, but ludwig, due\nto his deafness, can not, or will not, accept that. he also relates\nludwig's increasingly bizarre behavior, including incessantly singing\nsome tune, claiming that is the motif of a grand symphony. karl sings\nit (badly)---it's the main choral theme (ode to joy) of the 9th symphony.\n\nschindler and karl both go to ludwig to talk him out of his plan.\nbeethoven verbally abuses schindler, telling him to get out.\n\nkarl, truly at the end of his tether at this point, takes a dueling\npistol and attempts to kill himself. he is a very bad shot, and\ninjures himself but does not die. he is taken to his mother's\nupholstery shop. beethoven and schindler both go there. karl writes to\nbeethoven (everyone was communicating with him by writing in notebooks\nor on small slates) \"never show your face to me again\". ludwig's\ndesolation is complete. he is universally despised for what he had\ndriven karl to. he is shown being physically abused on the street by\nyoung hooligans, who beat him senseless. the scene ends with him\nlying unconscious in the street.\n\nwarning: spoiler coming up.\n\nthe biographical flashbacks end. schindler explains to countess\nerdody his reason for the visit; he needs to know who was the\n\"immortal beloved\" in the letter. the countess says \"the letter was\nnot written to me.\" \"then who?\" \"it was she who came between us. he\ncould not forget her.\" \"who is she?\" \"the answer was always in front\nof you.\" she tells him, off camera, who she was. he gets into his\ncoach, not knowing what to do. she says \"go to her\".\n\nschindler is then seen entering johanna reiss's upholstery shop. he\nasks to speak to her in private. she is quite cold to him, but he\nimplores her. they go upstairs. he asks to see a sample of her\nhandwriting. she continues to be hostile, but he persuades her. he\nthen brings out the page from the hotel register and sees that the\nhandwriting matches. she demands to know what that page is. \"a page\nfrom a hotel registry in karlsbad, signed by you. did you ever meet\nludwig in karlsbad?\" \"you can hardly be unaware of the manner in which\ni suffered at his hands. i find the question as insulting as it is\nimpudent. what are you implying?\" her hostility eventually subsides,\nand she explains that she had made peace with him, in her own mind,\nbecause of the ode to joy (9th symphony.) \"i could not hate the man\nwho could write such music.\"\n\nthe final three flashbacks follow. the first is the premiere\nperformance of the 9th symphony. beethoven walks up on stage at some\npoint (another conductor was at the podium), and stares blankly at the\nmusicians, being unable to hear the performance. he becomes lost in a\npersonal reverie. he is hearing the ode to joy in is mind\nduring this. he recalls an incident as a child when he ran away from\nhis violently abusive father. he runs through the woods while the 9th\nsymphony plays. (this scene solves the problem of depicting\nbeethoven's deafness while treating the audience to his music. he\ncan't hear the concert, but the symphony is played as he runs through\nthe woods in his fantasy.) he finally reaches a small pond, and, just\nat the big crescendo of the ode to joy, lies down in the water and is\nshown in a cosmic oneness with the heavens.\n\nat the end of the cosmic scene, we are brought back to the concert\nhall. the symphony has ended, though beethoven doesn't realize it.\nthe sound track has been turned off to depict his deafness. the\naudience is silently applauding, but beethoven doesn't see them. then\nthe conductor turns beethoven around, so he can see the audience, who\nleap to their feet with load and thunderous applause.\n\nin the second of the final flashbacks, johanna visits beethoven on his\ndeathbed, and he writes out a document transferring guardianship of\nkarl back to her. they hold hands briefly in apparent awareness of\ntheir lost love.\n\nfinally, johanna tells schindler \"yes, i once loved him. but he\nturned his back on me. i never heard a word from him. i was a fool.\ni never meant anything to him.\" \"but, the letter.\" \"what letter?\"\nafter a long pause, schindler realizes that she never saw the\nletter. he gives it to her.\n\nschindler leaves, and we see her sobbing in the window as she reads\nbeethoven's letter to his immortal beloved. the slow movement of the\nemperor concerto is played one last time, with one last narration of\nthe letter. the final flashback shows what had happened.\n\nmy angel, my all, my other self ... if we could be united, we would\nfeel this pain no longer ... soon, we shall live together, and what a\nlife it will be.\n\nall the time that caspar was courting her, she was actually sleeping\nwith ludwig. he comes to visit johanna at her upholstery shop. she\nis afraid that caspar will catch them. he says that he can no longer\nskulk around like a guilty schoolboy. they agree to meet at a hotel\nin karlsbad. she tells him that she is carrying his child. (that\nwould be karl!)\n\nshe arrives at the hotel, but, because of a terrible storm, beethoven\nis delayed. it is at this point that he writes the letter, and sends\nit on ahead of him.\n\nthe journey was dreadful ... the coach had to go and break down on\nsuch a terrible road for no reason ... and now i am held up\ncompletely.\n\nthe letter arrives, and frau streicher places it on a food tray, but\nnearly hidden under a plate of pastry.\n\ni have to see you ... however much you love me, i love you more.\n\njohanna takes the lid off a tureen of not-very-appetizing stew, and\nbecomes nauseous. (she is presumably experiencing morning sickness.)\nbecause of that, the terrible storm, and the belief that beethoven has\nstood her up, she despairs of the situation and checks out. she never\nsees the letter.\n\ni must go to sleep now. be calm, love. today, yesterday.\nwhat longing with tears for you.\n\nbeethoven arrives, sees that she has left, and goes on a destructive\nrampage. he then picks up the letter from the floor, not knowing that\nit had been nearly hidden. since it had been opened, he assumes that\nshe had read it and spurned him.\n\nwhile still in my bed, my thoughts turn to you, my immortal beloved\n... i can live only completely with you, or not at all ... you're my\nlife, my everything ... go on loving me. ever yours, ever mine,\nforever.\n\nin the final scene, johanna visits beethoven's grave, and the music turns\nfrom the pathos of the 2nd movement to the triumph of the 3rd.",
