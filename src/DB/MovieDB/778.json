 "Plot": [
  "dr jack mickler, a psychiatrist, is only 10 days away from his retirement. a week before he is due to leave, he encounters a young man who attempts suicide- would be a pretty straightforward case except the young man claims to be don juan, the fabled spanish nobleman and world renowned seducer/lover of woman. despite original hostility from his coworkers jack manages to persuade his associates to put the boy in his care for 10 days after which the boy will undergo an evaluation to be either released from psychiatric care or sent to a mental institution. however, as the 10 days progresses dr mickler and the other staff become gradually drawn into to the young man's exotic world of love, passion and pleasure as he recounts his story to them. whilst doing so the man's philosophies and zeal for life and love begins to revive dr mickler's somewhat passionless relationship with his wife, marilyn as well as challenging his own views and ethics to the point where both he and the audience begin to question: could this young man truly be don juan?", 
  "a young man (who is the legendary don juan?), comes to new york in search of his lost love. feeling like he has nothing to live for, he attempts to commit suicide from atop a billboard. dr. mickler is a soon retiring psychiatrist who helps don juan, come to his senses. he brings the costumed boy to the psychiatric hospital , in hopes of helping don juan find his identity. the doctor works with him for ten days, in which don tells his life story. mickler begins to believe that the young man is truly don juan, but the rest of the staff doesn't agree. the doctor knows that the only way out for don juan, is to pretend he's an average boy whose fantasy got the best of him.", 
  "a well-respected psychiatrist has a run-in with a young man who thinks he is don juan--or is he really? the don juan becomes his patient, and as the days pass, the psychiatrist starts to see that perhaps just because each person has his/her own reality doesn't mean they're crazy. \"don juan\", through his story-telling of his past, instills the psychiatrist with a new fire for life and love, changing his life.", 
  "psychiatrist jack mickler dissuades a would-be suicide; the 21-year old, costumed like zorro and claiming he's don juan, is held for a ten-day review in a mental institution. mickler, about to retire, insists on doing the evaluation, conducting it without medicating the youth. \"don juan\" tells his story - birth in mexico, the death of his father, a year in a harem, then finding true love (and being rejected) on a remote island. listening enlivens mickler's relationship with his own wife. as the ten days tick down and pressure mounts on mickler to support the youth's indefinite confinement, finding reality within the romantic imagination becomes jack's final professional challenge."
