  "the first, and by far most memorable full-length animated feature from the disney studios, \"snow white and the seven dwarfs\" may have been superseded technically by many of the films that followed it. but its simple story of a charming little princess saved from the evil deeds of her wicked step-mother, the queen, by a group of seven adorable dwarfs made history when it was first released in december, 1937 and has since become an incomparable screen classic."
