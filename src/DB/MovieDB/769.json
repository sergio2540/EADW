 "Synopsis": "a telecommunications company--travicom--is run by a paranoid, hot-headed tyrant(joe don baker). in a quest for a powerful 10.000 channel laser, he sends his son charlie into the congo region of africa to retrieve a raw flawless diamond to power the laser, while reporting via satlink, the camp is filled with dead bodies--the last image seen from charlie's cam is that of a mutant gorilla before it goes black. travis sends dr. ross(laura linney) to investigate, as she was charlie's fiance.it becomes obvious that travis' interest is for the diamond and not for his son, but dr. ross promises travis will pay if she is only going for the diamond and not charles.\n\nenter dr. elliott(dylan walsh) who taught a gorilla(amy) to talk using voice activated sign language invented for deaf-mute people. his assistant richard(grant heslov) is noticing amy's mental decline, which supposedly occurs in captive gorillas. dr. elliott wants to return amy to the congo, but can not afford the trip. a romanian philanthropist--mr. homolka(tim curry) offers to pay, as drawings amy painted have a symbol that he is interested in. mr.homolka's funds fall through on the day the plane is loading and laura linney appears in the nick of time to fund amy's return.\n\nthe flight to africa is interesting as we find amy drinks alcohol (wants \"green drop drink\"--martini) and is jealous of laura linney. landing in africa, the team is met by eddie ventro(joe pantoliano) and monro kelly(ernie hudson) with enough technogadgets and arms to start an incursion into a foreign land. while attempting to exit the airport, the group is discovered by captain wanta(delroy lindo) and demands a bribe to exit. it is found that dr. ross has plenty of cash and was an operative for the cia. it is also found tim curry is after king solomon's diamond mines in the lost city of zinge, and the image amy was drawing is from king solomon's mines.as their plane goes into zaire air space, they are fired upon, hit and damaged\nand have to exit via parachute.\n\nwhile reporting a sit rep to travis, dr. ross is told by travis that his primatologists identified the gorilla seen before charlie's camera as a new species of gray gorilla. just then amy knocks over the satlink destroying it, leaving travis to believe another gorilla attack, and sends another plane to find the diamond.\n\nthe group meets the \"ghost tribe\" while camping, who state there is a dead white man in the forest with the symbol of travicom on his shirt. the ghost tribe have several levels of dead and dr.ross identifies bob driscoll(john hawkes), a member of charlie's party. bob awakens and sees amy crawling towards him, begins to scream and dies of fright. the team travels further into the congo and is attacked by hippos as well as snakes.the team sees travis' second plane shot down. after camping one evening, the team awakens to the loss of porters and is unsure of where to go--the proverbial fork in the road. the decision is made to follow amy as she has the 'conviction' and 'passion' to go home.\n\nthe region of the congo they are in is geothermically unstable. amy meets a group of silverback gorillas and is snubbed leading dr.ross to believe amy doesn't belong anywhere. the team finds the perimeter of charlie's camp. yet can't find the bodies or equipment.\n\ninvestigation reveals the lost city of zinge with king solomon's mines. hieroglyphics state \"we are watching you\" over and over again. richard remains behind and is attacked. he runs to the group beaten and bloodied followed by a mutant gorilla. as richard dies, homolke states the legend of the killer ape is true.\n\ncamp is set like a scene from predator, with lasers and machine pistols. the mutants attack, and if not for the overwhelming firepower, the group would have been killed. the following morning, homolke is gone as well as amy.looking further, the team finds homolke at the diamond mine. he is warned not to touch the diamonds, but he starts to retrieve them. the mutants surround him and kill him and attack the team.\n\nthere is no way out and peter is taken by the mutants. just as they are to kill him, amy appears and protects him. ross finds charlie dead, the diamond and laser in his hand. she gets the laser working and 'cuts' her way out, giving the team a chance to escape. amy joins the silverbacks and ross uses the satcom from the second plane to let travis know his son is dead. he is more interested in the diamond. ross then aims the laser at the satellite and fries it, destroying travis' cash cow.\n\npeter, ross and monro leave with a hot air ballon and ross asks peter to toss the diamond. he does to monro's\"ouch\" and the wind takes them away........",
