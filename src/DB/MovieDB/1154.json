mind\n\nsugar?\n\njohnson: this is a dictionary, not a bible\n\nnatasha: isn't it the same in the lands without?\n\njohnson: now tell me, what's it for?\n\nnatasha: nearly every day words disappear, because they are forbidden\n\nthey are replaced by new words expressing new ideas\n\nin the last two or three months...\n\n...some words i was very fond of has disappeared\n\njohnson: which words? i

of?\n\nnatasha: i'm afraid because i know that word...\n\n...without ever having seen it or read it\n\n-which word?\n\n-le conscience\n\njohnson: la conscience\n\nnatasha: la... ...conscience\n\njohnson: you've never been to the lands without?\n\nare you sure?\n\nyou're lying\n\nnatasha: why are you cross with me?\n\njohnson: aren't you supposed to say \"because\", not \"why\"?\n\nnatasha: i said \"why\"?\n\njohnson: yes\n\nand if enemy ears are listening, they heard you, too\n\nnatasha: well, then, i was careless, because it's forbidden\n\nperhaps it's all right for you to use it\n\nwhen did i say \"why\"?\n\njohnson: another question first: where were you born?\n\nnatasha: here, in alphaville\n\njohnson: another lie. perhaps you're unaware of it, but you're lying\n\ni must know the truth: where were you born?\n\nnatasha: here, i told you\n\nin alphaville\n\njohnson: no, in tokyoama...\n\n...the land of the rising sun\n\ngo on, say it\n\nnatasha: in

come?\n\nnatasha: because they write incomprehensible things\n\nnow i know: it used to be called poetry\n\nit seems to hold secrets, but really it's empty\n\nwhen control has an hour or so free...\n\n...it codifies such stuff\n\nlike everything else, one never knows\n\njohnson: it might prove useful\n\nnatasha: absolutely. we're highly organized\n\ni'd like to go with you to the lands without\n\nbut i'm afraid\n\ni'm no longer normal\n\nwhen did i say \"why\"?\n\njohnson: why?\n\nnatasha: because... you know very well, mister johnson\n\nno, i don't\n\nat which moment?\n\njohnson:

chance\n\nall words without aforethought\n\nsentiments adrift\n\nmen roam the city\n\na glance, a word\n\nbecause i love you\n\neverything moves\n\nto live, only advance!\n\naim straight for those you love\n\ni went towards you, endlessly towards the light\n\nif you smile, it is to enfold me all the better\n\nthe rays of your arms pierce the mist\n\njohnson: how will the chief engineer use me?\n\nnatasha: as an inter-galaxy double agent, i think\n\njohnson: so it's true what heckle said\n\nyou send spies to sabotage the rest of the world\n\nnatasha: of course; we learn that at school\n\njohnson: are you going to betray me?\n\n[johnson places his hand around natasha's throat and she nods \"yes\"]\n\nyou can't talk? or don't you mean to?\n\n[she shakes her head \"no\"]\n\ncan

sweet coffee...\n\n...adding, \"i shan't pay, because i'm afraid of no one\"\n\nhe drank his coffee\n\nhe left\n\nhe didn't pay for his coffee\n\nfor the sake of peace, the caf\u00e9 owner said nothing\n\nbut when the tiny man repeated the trick three times...\n\n...the caf\u00e9 owner decided to get a tough to sort him out\n\nso, on the fourth day...\n\n...when the tiny man called for his cup of coffee...\n\n...the tough lumbered up to him and said:\n\n\"so you're afraid of no one?\"\n\n\"that's right\"\n\n\"well, neither am i\"\n\n\"make that two cups of coffee\", called the man\n\n[johnson begins laughing hysterically]\n\nmeet you outside residents' control\n\nyou'll stay here, miss vonbraun\n\nscene:\n\ninterrogation room\n\n[voice:]\n\nalpha 60: last night you

so that failure is impossible\n\ni shall fight so that failure is impossible\n\neverything that i project shall be accomplished\n\ndon't count on it; i have a secret, too\n\nwhat is your secret? tell me, mister caution\n\nsomething which never changes, day or night\n\nthe past represents its future, it advances in a straight line...\n\n...yet it ends by coming full circle\n\ni cannot trace what it is\n\ni won't tell you\n\nseveral of my circuits...\n\n...are looking for the solution to your riddle\n\ni will find it\n\nif you find it, you will destroy yourself simultaneously...\n\n...because you will become my kin, my brother\n\nthose who are not born, do not weep...\n\n...and do not regret\n\nthus it is logical to condemn you to death\n\nstuff yourself with your logic\n\nmy judgment is just...\n\n...and i am working for the universal good\n\nif you plan to drive us from the other galaxies, you'll fail\n\nyou will not leave; the exit is blocked\n\nwe'll see\n\n[johnson crashes through door, firing. kills man in stairway]\n\n[natasha is brought into the building but resists the agents as they struggle to get her into the lobby]\n\n[johnson avoids the agents, and natasha, and

stairs]\n\nprofessor: what can i do for you, mister caution?\n\njohnson: news travels fast here\n\nprofessor: because we're very rapidly entering light civilization\n\njohnson: i'm returning to the lands without. come with me\n\nprofessor: stay with us, mister caution\n\nwhen the war's over i'll put you in charge of another galaxy\n\nyou will have money and women\n\nwe are mastering a science so fantastic...\n\n...that the old american and russian atomics will see pathetic\n\njohnson: i see\n\nyou oppose my moral, even supernatural, sense of vocation...\n\n...with a simple physical and mental existence...\n\n...easily controllable by technicians\n\n[lights flash on several control panels]\n\nprofessor: your ideas are strange\n\nsome years ago, in the age of ideas, yours would have been thought sublime\n\nlook at yourself. men of your type will soon be extinct\n\nyou'll be something worse than dead\n\nyou'll become a legend\n\njohnson: yes, i'm afraid of death...\n\n...but for a humble secret agent that's a fact of life, like whisky\n\nand i've drunk that all my life\n\n[johnson reveals a gun]\n\nyou never want to see the lands without again?\n\nprofessor: good-bye, mister caution\n\n[shot]\n\nsuch people will serve as terrible examples...\n\n...to those who want to play the world...\n\n...when technical power is the only act in their repertoire\n\n[walking across balcony johnson is fired upon from below by a policeman]\n\ni was running a straight line which, like dickson's greek labyrinth...\n\n...and its baffled philosophers, could disorientate a secret agent\n\n[johnson returns to the hallways of interrogation where men and women move along disoriented with the walls as their only means of guidance]\n\n[alpha 60:]\n\nin many respects...\n\n...your reactions and your modes of thought...\n\n...differ...\n\n...from present normality\n\n[johnson:]\n\nthe inhabitants of alphaville are not normal\n\nthey are products of mutation\n\ndo you accept our proposal?\n\nanswer silently...\n\n...with yes or no\n\n[johnson gets into a car; a tall man in a black suit leans against the hood]\n\ni'll never betray the lands without\n\n[johnson engages the agent, knocks him down and drives over his head in an escape from the parking garage]\n\n[johnson is pursued by two cars as he drives toward the north]\n\n[voice:]\n\nthe present is terrifying...\n\n...because it is irreversible...\n\n...and because it has a will of iron\n\ntime is the substance of which i am made\n\n[johnson searches interrogation rooms as men stumble down the hall. a woman stands motionless against wall]\n\ntime is a river which carries me along\n\nbut i am time\n\nit's a tiger, tearing me apart; but i am the tiger\n\n[johnson finds natasha in an interrogation room]\n\njohnson: look at her and me, there's your reply\n\nwe're happiness, and we're heading towards it\n\nalpha 60: it is our misfortune that the world is reality\n\nand i...\n\n...it is my misfortune that i am myself, alpha 60\n\n[natasha is dazed and helped by johnson down the hall]\n\njohnson: natasha, think of the word love\n\n[she regains her balance and they continue to escape]\n\n[in the lobby natasha is still dazed. johnson carries her to the parking garage]\n\nnot all the inhabitants died, but they were all stricken\n\nthose not asphyxiated by the absence of light...\n\n...sped about crazily, like ants\n\nit was 23.15, oceanic time...\n\n...when natasha and i left alphaville by the ring road\n\na night drive across intersidereal space, and we'd be home\n\njohnson: don't look back\n\nnatasha: do you think they're all dead?\n\njohnson: not yet\n\nthey may recover, and alphaville will be happy, like florence\n\nlike angoul\u00eame city, like

strangely\n\njohnson: yes\n\nnatasha: you're waiting for me to say something to you\n\njohnson: yes\n\nnatasha: i don't know what to say\n\nthey're words i don't know\n\ni wasn't taught them\n\nhelp me\n\njohnson: impossible, princess. help yourself, then you'll be saved\n\nif you don't, you're as lost as the dead of alphaville\n\nnatasha: i\n\nlove\n\nyou\n\ni love you\n\nthe end",
