 "Plot": [
  "when a documentary crew traveling through the amazon jungle, picks up a stranded man, they are unaware of the trouble that will occur. this stranger's hobby is to capture the giant anaconda snake, and plans to continue targeting it on their boat, by any means necessary.", 
  "a group of documentary makers in the rain forest are terrorized by a giant anaconda snake, which an insane snake expert wants to capture.", 
  "sent on a national geographic survey of the jungle to capture the largest anaconda, a group of cardboard cutouts posing as actors bite off more than they can chew and get chewed up by an over sized and very agitated snake. that sums up the film. what looks like it may be a turkey is saved by a cgi snake upstaging all the actors and devouring them. unfortunately j-lo survives since she would be too glamorous to be devoured and she would have made the snake look tame by comparison by throwing a hissy fit if she was to be eaten. the perfect saturday night film showing that not all films need to aspire to citizen kane and fun for the sake of it is an art form in itself", 
  "a film crew headed by anthropologist steve cale and director terri flores journey through a river to find a mysterious indian tribe and shoot a documentary on them. they save a guy called paul sarone from a sinking boat. he offers to help in their search for the tribe, but he is actually a snake-hunter looking for legendary anaconda snake, and when cale is bitten by some tropical insect, sarone takes over the boat.",

 "Synopsis": "shooting a documentary about a long-lost indian tribe on the amazon river, director terri flores (lopez) and members of her crew, including cameraman danny rich (ice cube) and professor steven cale (stoltz), come across stranded snake hunter paul sarone (voight) and help him, believing he knows how to find the tribe they're searching for, but sarone acts strangely and the crew suspect something. when cale is bitten by a poisonous wasp which entered his mouth (leaving him unconscious for nearly the rest of the film), sarone takes command of the boat...and the crew.\n\nthey are then forced to help him achieve his true objective; hunting down and capturing a record-breaking green anaconda he had been tracking. during the process, several members of the crew are killed before the snake itself is shot dead and sarone incapacitated by the newly awakened cale.\n\nlater on, terri and danny, two of the surviving members of the crew, are captured when sarone catches up to them. he dumps a bucket of animal blood on them and then uses them as bait in an attempt to capture a second, larger anaconda.\n\nthe anaconda, terri and danny are caught in a net by sarone, but escape when the snake breaks free. the survivors cut their bonds and break free as sarone himself is killed by his quarry. the snake becomes trapped in the smoke stack, which danny ignites and it seems to have died. as terri and danny recuperate on a nearby dock and the snake appears one final time. danny beats the anaconda with an axe until it is finally slain.\n\nafterwards, the survivors of the expedition reunite on the ship, and as they float down the river, accidentally locate the natives they were originally searching for. they realize sarone was right and begin filming their documentary as the movie ends.\n\n",
