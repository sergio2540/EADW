arranged marriage she leaves her native scotland accompanied by her daughter and her beloved piano life in the rugged forests of new zealands south island is not all she may have imagined and nor is her relationship with her new husband stewart she suffers torment and loss when stewart sells her piano to a neighbour george ada learns from george that she may earn back her piano by giving him piano lessons but only with certain other conditions attached at first ada despises george but slowly their relationship is transformed and this propels them into a dire situation the piano tells the story of a mute scotswoman ada mcgrath holly hunter whose father sells her into marriage to a new zealand frontiersman alistair stewart sam neill she is shipped off along with her young daughter flora mcgrath anna paquin ada has not spoken a word since she was six years old expressing herself instead through her piano playing and through sign language for which her daughter has served as the interpreter ada cares little for the mundane world occupying herself for hours every day with the piano it is never made explicitly clear why she ceased to speak flora it is later learned is the product of a relationship with a teacher whom ada believed she could control with her mind making him love her but who became frightened and stopped listening and thus left herada flora and their belongings including the piano are deposited on a new zealand beach by the ships crew against her angry objections as there is no one there to meet them they spend the night alone sheltering under a tiny tent made of a hoop skirt frame the following day alistair arrives with a mori crew and his friend baines harvey keitel a fellow forester and a retired sailor who has adopted many of the maori customs including tattooing his face and socializing with the maori instead of his own race save alistair there are insufficient men to carry everything and alistair abandons the piano again eliciting objections from adaalistair proves to be a shy and diffident man who is jokingly called old dry balls by his maori cohorts he tells ada that there is no room in his small house for the piano ada in turn makes no effort to befriend him and continues to try to be reunited with her piano unable to communicate with alistair she goes with flora to baines and asks to be taken to the piano he agrees and the three spend the day as she plays tunes on the beach while he socially allies himself with the maori baines has steadfastly refused any sexual activity with their women but he clearly finds ada attractive due to her passion for music baines eventually retrieves the instrument and suggests that alistair trade it and lessons from ada for some land that alistair wants alistair consents oblivious to the budding attraction between ada and baines she is surprised to find that he has had the piano put into perfect tune after its rough journey he asks to simply listen rather than learn to play himself and then offers to let her buy the piano back one key at a time by letting him do things he likes while she plays ada ambivalently agrees as she is attracted to baines in the meantime ada and alistair have had no sexual or even mildly affectionate interaction even though they are by now formally marriedbaines is sexually aroused by adas playing to the point that he openly approaches her finally she yields to her own lust one afternoon and she and baines have sex alistair finally begins to suspect the love affair and after discovering them he angrily boards up his home with ada inside when he goes off to work on his timberland after that interlude ada avoids baines and feigns affection with alistair though her caresses only serve to frustrate him more because when he makes a move to touch her in return she pulls away before alistair departs on his next journey he asks ada if she will go to see baines she shakes her head no and he tells her he trusts that she wont go to him while hes gonesoon after ada sends her daughter with a package for baines containing a single piano key with an inscribed love declaration flora has begun to accept alistair as her papa and is angered by her mothers infidelity she brings the piano key instead to alistair after reading the love note burnt onto the piano key alistair furiously returns home and chops off adas index finger with an axe to deprive her of the ability to play her pianoafter ada recovers from her injury alistair sends her and flora away with baines and dissolves their marriage they depart from the same beach on which she first landed in new zealand while being rowed to the ship with her baggage and the piano jammed into a rowboat ada feels that the piano is ruined as she can no longer play and insists that baines throw the piano overboard as it sinks she deliberately puts her foot into the loops of rope trailing overboard she is rapidly pulled deep underwater connected by the rope to the piano but then she changes her mind and kicks free to be pulled back into the boatin an epilogue ada describes her life with baines and flora in nelson england where she has started to give piano lessons in their new home and her severed finger has been replaced with a silver digit made by baines ada says that she imagines her piano in its grave in the sea and herself suspended above it which lulls me to sleep ada has also started to take speech lessons in order to learn how to speak again the film closes with the thomas hood quote from his poem silence which also opened the filmthere is a silence where hath been no sound there is a silence where no sound may be in the cold grave under the deep deep sea 7.6piano new zealand arranged marriage mute forest 1850s piano lesson minister
