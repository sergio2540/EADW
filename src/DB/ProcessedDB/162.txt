calling him norman and he refers to her as fat she then introduces a 13yearold boy named billy ray the son of her boyfriend bill ray and asks her mother about normans memory problems norman is brusque with bill who is clearly not comfortable in the rustic setting given his apprehensions about bears and they make small talk about aging with bill noting that he is now 45 bill is even more awkward in explaining that hes still recovering from his divorce and how chelsea has made his life better their friction increases as bill tells norman he intends to sleep in the same bed with chelsea which norman sarcastically accepts bill tells norman it will not be easy getting to know him and he does not want to be tauntedbilly who is fond of saying the word bullshit reluctantly agrees to spend time with norman while bill watches chelsea and ethel skinnydipping in the pond after dark norman asks billy what he does for fun and the boy boasts that he sucks face with girls in response norman tells

foolish idea and tells him to go fishing with him and ethel the trio head out on the motorboat ethel reads under a parasol while the men fish billy later tries to impress them by diving off a dock into the lake but his attempts are rather sloppysome time later norman takes billy out fishing again explaining that a huge trout lives in the lake that he has been trying to catch for years which he has nicknamed walter ethel comes by later in a smaller boat and embarrasses them by bringing lunch norman catches and reels in a rather large trout which billy helps him bring into the boat although he tells him that walter is a much larger fishthat night norman starts a fire in the fireplace that gets out of control causing ethel and jimmy to put it out norman gets upset at jimmy even though he knows the fire was his fault ethel asks billy to have patience with norman who is just doing the best he canon another day ethel persuades norman to let jimmy take out the motorboat on his own and she is then surprised when norman gives her some immodest kisses having gained confidence in jimmy norman later takes him to a special fishing area called purgatory cove where the rocks eat boats jimmy carefully guides norman through even though heavy clouds have darkened the sky while they are fishing norman ponders that he wont be around long enough to catch walter and jimmy just then catches what he thinks is the treasured fish only to find it is a dead loon jimmy asks norman if he is afraid to die and the old man is resentful to speak about itnorman then trusts jimmy to drive the boat while he guides him out of the rocks they are moving along well until jimmy accidentally accelerates and slams the boat into a rock launching norman into the lake jimmy dives in and helps norman to a rock norman who is bleeding from the head and traumatized still manages to hang on to jimmy and help him cling to the rockafter some hours ethel goes to the postman and convinces him to go out into the lake to find norman and jimmy spying them hanging onto the rock in purgatory cove ethel dives off the boat and into the water swimming out to them norman swiftly tells her you shouldnt be out this
