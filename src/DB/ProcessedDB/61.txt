scheme to purchase different pieces of land that they knew were going to be targeted by big companies for development and resell for large profits karol beats them to it and then tells his exbosses that if they kill him all his estate shall go to the catholic church and they are therefore forced to purchase all the land from him with the money he gained from this scheme and with the payment from
