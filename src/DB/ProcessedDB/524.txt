semels charles sullivan carl voss leo white harry wilson twenty years after the end of wwi in which the nation of tomainia was on the losing side adenoid hynkel has risen to power as the ruthless dictator of the country he believes in a pure aryan state and the decimation of the jews this situation is unknown to a simple jewishtomainian barber who has since been hospitalized the result of a wwi battle upon his release the barber who had been suffering from memory loss about the war is shown the new persecuted life of the jews by many living in the jewish ghetto including a washerwoman named hannah with whom he begins a relationship the barber is ultimately spared such persecution by commander schultz who he saved in that wwi battle the lives of all jews in tomainia are eventually spared with a policy shift by hynkel himself who is doing so for ulterior motives but those motives include a want for world domination starting with the invasion of neighboring osterlich which may be threatened by benzino napaloni the dictator of neighboring bacteria ultimately schultz who has turned traitor against hynkels regime and the barber may be able to join forces to take control of the situation they using schultzs inside knowledge of the workings of the regime and the barbers uncanny resemblance to one of those in power during the last days of the first world war a clumsy soldier saves the life of devoted military pilot schultz unfortunately their flight from the advancing enemy ends in a severe crash with the clumsy soldier losing his memories after quite some years in the hospital the amnesia patient gets released and reopens his old barber shop in the jewish ghetto but times have changed in the country of tomania dictator adenoid hynkel who accidentally looks very similar to the barber has laid his merciless grip on the country and the jewish people are discriminated against one day the barber gets in trouble and is brought before a commanding officer who turns out to be his old comrade schultz so the ghetto enjoys protection from then on meanwhile dictator hynkel develops big plans he wants to become dictator of the whole world and needs a scapegoat for the public soon schultz is being arrested for being too jewishfriendly and all jews except those who managed to flee are transported into concentration camps hynkel is planning to march into osterlich to show off against napaloni dictator of bacteria who already has deployed his troops along the other border of the small country meanwhile schultz and the barber manage to escape guised in military uniforms as luck would have it schultz and the barber are picked up by tomanian forces and the barber is mixed up with hynkel himself the small barber now gets the onceinalifetime chance to speak to the people of osterlich and all of tomania who listen eagerly on the radio during a battle in the last months of world war i the protagonist an unnamed soldier known only in the credits as a jewish barber is fighting for the central powers in the army of the fictional nation of tomainia comically blundering through the trenches in combat scenes upon hearing a fatigued pilot pleading for help the barber attempts to rescue the exhausted officer commander schultz the two board schultzs nearby airplane and fly off barely escaping enemy ground fire schultz reveals that he is carrying important dispatches that could win the war however the plane loses fuel and crashes in a marsh they both survive but the barber suffers from memory loss as medics arrive commander schultz gives them the dispatches but is told that the war has just ended and tomainia lostyears later as the barber is released from the hospital adenoid hynkel also played by chaplin the ruthless dictator of tomainia has undertaken to persecute jews throughout his country aided by secretary of the interior and minister of propaganda garbitsch and minister of war herring the symbol of hynkels fascist regime is the double cross and at times when hes excited or angry hynkel speaks in a macaronic parody of the german language during his first speech his tomainian is translated by an overly concise englishspeaking news voiceoverthe barber unaware of hynkels rise to power returns to his barbershop in the jewish ghetto when he opposes the painting of the word jew on his barber shop by storm troopers he flees from them aided in part by his neighbor hannah who knocks some of them unconscious with a frying pan the barber is nearly lynched by a gang of storm troopers but schultz now a highranking officer in hynkels regime intervenes though surprised to see the man who saved his life at the end of the war is not an aryan as he previously imagined he returns the favor by ordering the storm troopers to take no action against him or hannah even when she throws an object at a storm troopers headhynkel relaxes his stance on tomainian jewry in an attempt to woo a jewish financier into giving him a loan to support his regime egged on by garbitsch hynkel has become obsessed with the idea of being dictator of the world dancing at one point with a large inflatable globe to the tune of the prelude to act i of richard wagners lohengrinhynkel plans to invade the neighboring country of osterlich austria and needs the loan to finance the invasion when the jewish financier refuses due to the persecution of the jews hynkel reinstates and intensifies his persecution of the jews contrary to garbitschs advice when schultz who is empathetic to the jews voices his objection to the pogrom hynkel denounces schultz as a supporter of democracy and a traitor and orders him placed in a concentration camp the barber evades storm troopers who have heard of the arrest by hiding on his neighbor mr jaeckels roof with hannah however his shop is burnt down schultz flees to the ghetto and begins planning to overthrow the hynkel regime with hannah the barber and other residents there schultz proposes a suicide mission to blow up the palace the agent will be chosen by a coin in a pudding however hannah causes this to be abandoned by placing coins in all the puddings later the ghetto is searched for schultz he and the barber hiding on the roof are captured and condemned to the camphynkel is initially opposed by benzino napaloni dictator of bacteria in his plans to invade osterlich and even plans to declare war however just after he signs a declaration of war he receives a call from napaloni he invites him and his wife to his palace and a seeing of a military show to impress him with a display of military might and psychological warfare but this ends in disaster after some friction a comedic food fight between the two leaders and a deal between the two leaders on which hynkel immediately reneges his invasion proceeds hannah and others from the ghetto had emigrated to osterlich to escape hynkel but once again they find themselves living under hynkels regimeschultz and the barber escape from the camp wearing tomainian uniforms border guards mistake the barber for hynkel to whom he is nearly identical in appearance conversely hynkel on a duckhunting trip falls overboard and is mistaken for the barber and arrested by his own soldiers the barber now forced by circumstance to assume hynkels identity is taken to the capital of osterlich to make a victory speech garbitsch in introducing hynkel to the throngs decries free speech and argues for the subjugation of the jews the barber then makes a rousing speech reversing hynkels antisemitic policies and declaring that tomainia and osterlich will now be a free nation and a democracy he calls for humanity in general to break free from dictatorships and use science and progress to make the world better insteadhannah now an impoverished laborer in a vineyard in osterlich hears the barbers speech on the radio and is amazed when the barber addresses her directly hannah can you hear me wherever you are look up hannah the clouds are lifting the sun is breaking through we are coming out of the darkness into the light we are coming into a new world a kindlier world where men will rise above their hate their greed and brutality look up hannah the soul of man has been given wings and at last he is beginning to fly he is flying into the rainbow into the light of hope into the future the glorious future that belongs to you to me and to all of us look up hannah look up as she rises mr jaeckel asks hannah hannah did you hear that the girl silences him with a gesture saying listen and turns her face radiant with joy and hope toward the sunlight 8.5barber dictator jew battle soldier jewish-ghetto amnesia invasion persecution radio good-versus-evil bolt-action-rifle cannon megalomaniac dual-role prison-camp
