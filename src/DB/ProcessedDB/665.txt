davis niall buggy hi ching danielle edmond tom woodruff jr after escaping from the alien planet the ship carrying ellen ripley crashes onto a remote and inhabited ore refinery while living in the ore refinery until she is rescued by her employers ripley discovers the horrifying reason for her crash an alien stowaway as the alien matures and begins to kill off the inhabitants ripley is unaware that her true enemy is more than just the killer alien the film begins on board an escape vessel in which ripley newt hicks and a droid called bishop are traveling on the pod crashes on a planet inhabited by prisoners who have been left to govern themselves in a facility killing newt hicks and destroying bishop ripley is revived from her cryosleep from the prison doctor and soon discovers what happened to her and her remaining crew members after calling for assistance from the company they wait for ripley to be transported off the planet as she doesnt belong there after a short time a shavenheaded ripley starts discovering that prisoners are being killed in a very similar manner to that of the aliens she has faced in the previous two films once this is discovered she and the remaining prisoners must devise a plan to kill the alien that stalks the prison facility hiding in ventilation shafts however she soon discovers that that it isnt the only alien on the planet there is also a queen but where despite the efforts of ripley and the space marines in the film aliens an embryonic alien infiltrates the starship it accidentally triggers the ships emergency systems dropping the escape capsule to the surface of a nearby planet ripley finds herself in a prison colony peopled by a religious cult composed of former murderers and rapists meanwhile the alien has managed to grow into a new and deadly form and is picking off the weaponless prisoners ripley soon discovers much to her horror that the real danger is much more personal the movie starts right at the end of the second film where ellen ripley and survivors start to travel back home but unfortunately they crash land on some prison planet and ripley discovers that her companions are already dead because of the alien now the nightmare starts again as the alien is beginning to kill some of the inhabitants of the prison after escaping with newt and hicks from the alien planet ripley crash lands on fiorina 161 a prison planet and host to a correctional facility unfortunately although newt and hicks do not survive the crash a more unwelcome visitor does the prison does not allow weapons of any kind and with aid being a long time away the prisoners must simply survive in any way they can when help does arrive the true intentions of the company become clear scenes that were cut from the theatrical version of the film but restored for the 2003 dvd assembly cut appear in red scenes that appear only in the theatrical version and no longer in the assembly cut appear in bluein the opening credits of the film the sulaco the large military ship carrying the survivors from the mission to lv426 as seen in the movie aliens is en route to earth newt hicks ripley sigourney weaver and the remains of the android bishop lance henriksen are all safely in hypersleep however a stowaway alien egg on the ship has released a facehugger it breaks the glass of one of the tubes wounding itself acid dripping from the facehugger starts an electrical fire and the ship responds automatically the medical scanner shows the facehugger as it impregnates one of the sleeping figures unable to contain the fire the automated systems of the sulaco eject all the cryotubes into an escape pod and eject the pod into outer space the navigation systems lead the escape vehicle to the nearest planet which happens to be fiorina fury 161 home to a penal colony populated by lifesentence xyychromosome prisoners all of whom are multiple murderers and rapists unsurprisingly it is owned and operated by weylandyutani the omnipresent company that employed ripley the eev crash lands in the water near the shorea man dr clemens charles dance wanders alone along the shoreline when he sees a strange figure lying on the beach it is ripley covered in mud and barely alive clemens takes her inside and warns the prisoners that an eev has crashlanded and that they need to extract it from the water quickly he performs cpr on ripley who starts breathing again in the meanwhile the prisoners use oxen to pull the remains of the eev from the water superintendent andrews brian glover prepares a message to the company message screens read that the eev has been salvaged but the young female newt has drowned corporal hicks is dead and bishop is hopelessly smashed ripley is the only survivor as she receives immediate care at the infirmary the prisoners tow the wreckage back to the prison by crane spike the rottweiler belonging to one of the inmates barks fiercely at a facehugger that is still inside the eev and goes unnoticed by the prison crewmr aaron ralph brown andrews assistant assembles the inmates as they go into prayer in an attempt to prevent rumours from spreading director andrews brian glover announces the news to the prison population making note that the only survivor of the eev crash is a woman dillon charles s dutton the spiritual leader of the prisoners views the presence of a woman to be disruptive in the allmale population out of concern for the spiritual wellbeing of his brothers many of whom have adopted a fundamentalist millenarian denomination of christianity and have vowed celibacy andrews comforts them by saying that he has requested a company rescue team to pick her up he leaves ripley in the care of doctor clemens charles dance under orders that shes not to leave the infirmary until the rescue ship arrives for herripley awakens from hypersleep and is disoriented but clemens stabilizes her with an injection she is distraught to learn of her circumstances especially the news that her companions are dead she demands that clemens take her to the wreckage of the eev he takes her through the blast furnace to the eev and explains that the prison once accomodated 5000 inmates but has since been reduced to a custodial staff of 25 to keep the furnace functioning she hears that hicks got hit by a support beam upon impact and was instantly dead bishop was lying around in pieces what was left of him was dumped on the trash heap the news that newt drowned in her cryotube after the ship crashed makes her break down in tears despite clemens assurance that newt probably wasnt conscious when it happened before she can process the information she sees some acid scorching from the facehugger on the side of the cryotube and immediately suspects the presence of an alien ripley asks to see newts body clemens takes her to the morgue he asks her if newt was her daughter she denies it she asks to be alone with newt for a while as clemens leaves she looks for signs that newt was impregnated by a facehugger as there is none she eventually insists on an autopsy under the guise of a communicable infection cholera clemens is suspicious but gives in to her emotional request the autopsy is gruesome for ripley to watch but clemens finds nothing but the usual signs that the child drowned superintendant andrews and mr aaron ralph brown enter dismayed that clemens started an autopsy without their approval clemens claims there was risk of infectious disease and did not want to take any risks andrews explains that he wants ripley confined to the infirmary as he doesnt wish to upset the religious male population ripley insists that the bodies be cremated to which andrews protests until clemens assures him that the risk of cholera outbreak is still present andrews allows clemens and the prisoners to prepare a funeral for her friendsinmates murphy christopher fairbank and frank linknm0153704 drag a lifeless ox inside the kitchen and hang her upside down for her to be slaughtered later they discuss ripley and seem to forget about their celibacy vows for a moment apparently the ox dropped dead for no direct reason as they leave one of the inmates finds a dead facehugger inmate murphy christopher fairbank is looking for spike his rottweiler he finds the animal apprehensive and with wounds in its face but otherwise healthy he wonders who could do such a thing to a dogsince the prison was used as a lead works at one time the prisoners will use the blast furnace to cremate the bodies andrews reads a short ceremonial text for the deceased followed by a chilling and powerful eulogy by dillon unseen by anyone a new alien is born spike the rottweiler goes into convulsions and explodes with a chestburster that moves on all fours emerging running off to some distant location inside the mazelike prison complex the dead ox in the kitchen starts to twitch and a chestburster that moves on all fours emerges running off to some distant location inside the mazelike prison complexripley whose head is now shaved due to the lice problem on the planet bathes herself she has now said goodbye to her new surrogate family and is once again starting over in the mess hall dillon confronts prisoners boggs leon herbert and rains christopher john fields who complain about fellow inmate golic paul mcgann they refuse to work with him as they think that he is crazy and smells bad dillon reproaches them for this and demands they treat golic like an equal ripley enters the mess hall and attempts to thank dillon for his eulogy despite his disturbing warning he informs her that he is a murderer and rapist of women she sits down at his table he asks her about her faith assuring her that although there is strictly no place for women in their adopted religion they will nevertheless tolerate herin a private moment clemens informs ripley about the history of the prisoners and the penal colony how they stayed after the company closed the prison their adopted religion and his tense relation with andrews she tries to find out how he got his current position as medical officer on such a barren place clemens eludes the answer by asking about the real reason for the autopsy but ripley evades the question by seducing him the two of them become attracted to one another and share a sexual encountermeanwhile prisoner murphy christopher fairbank is working in an isolated tunnel when he finds a shedded skin hearing movement he thinks it is his dog spike he finds the embryonic alien finishing its metamorphosis into an adult it attacks him spitting acid in his face blinded and howling with pain he falls backwards into a gigantic fan and is immediately shredded to bitsclemens again tries to get information from ripley but she wants to know about a barcode she noticed on the back of his head he says he will tell her some other time clemens is called away to investigate murphys remains andrews is quick to conclude that murphy was too distracted by the presence of ripley and came to close to the sucking fan clemens however concludes that the fan was set on blowing he also finds a burn mark not dissimilar to the one ripley discovered on newts tube when he leaves andrews requests a private conversation laterclemens finds ripley rummaging inside the eev wreckage retrieving its flight recorder he tells her about murphys death and the burn he found she begins to realize that maybe an alien did survive after all clemens wants to help her but insists that ripley trust him and tell him the whole story she replies that for this she needs to recover bishops remains so she can access information from the eevs flight recorder clemens points her the way to the garbage dump but he cannot escort her there as he has a meeting with andrewsmeanwhile boggs rains and golic are prepped to go on a survey assignment dillon asks them to light a candle for murphy on the way clemens enters andrews office at first andrews acts very nice but then suddenly he turns verbally aggressive andrews berates clemens for letting ripley wander on alone apparently the installation has received an unprecedented communication from weylandyutani regarding ripley the automated communications with the sulaco have informed them of ripleys whereabouts and they have dispatched a rescue team to come pick her up andrews understands that ripley must be very important to them but cant imagine why after a hostile exchange with clemens where the warden threatens to share clemens dark history with ripley andrews grills him about what he might know about ripley he can only confirm that she was part of a combat team that was wiped out andrews dismisses himripley finds bishops remains in the garbage dump as she tries to leave she is cornered by three prisoners they attack her and nearly rape her dillon rescues her and properly reeducates his brothers beating them with a piece of steel as she leaves ripley punches one of her attackers viciously in the facegolic finds an old cigarette machine and grabs as much cigarettes as he can much to the annoyance of boggs and rains boggs leon herbert rains christopher john fields and golic paul mcgann arrive in a large room and start placing candles to measure up the area however somewhere in the distance some candles are blown out assuming one of the inmates is pulling a prank rains goes in to investigate he finds a fully grown alien grabbing and biting him boggs and golic come to investigate the screaming and upon seeing the monster they run away back to the entrance only to find rains dead body lying there boggs is suddenly snatched and attacked from above by the alien it rips out boggs throat and the blood sprays on golic who flees the area in blind panicelsewhere ripley reconnects what is left of bishop to a power supply in the infirmary and reactivates him he immediately notices ripleys new hairstyle meanwhile golic has returned to the mess hall where an inmate finds him eating smiling manically while covered in blood the inmate returns with dillon and some others who restrain golic using bishop to access the flight recorder from the eev ripley finds out that a fire caused the ejection from the sulaco and bishop confirms that an alien traveled with them to fiorina 161 this information has been shared with the network so the company knows about this as well as he is beyond decent repair at his wishes ripley disconnects him permanentlygolic is dragged into the infirmary babbling about a dragon that attacked his friends andrews and the others dismiss him as insane but dillon defends him stating that golic may be a fool but he has never been a liar andrews even refuses to believe ripley after she confirms his story she requests a meeting with him later that evening which he grants her after his duties ripley tells him all about the alien but she learns that aside from some knives and fire axes there are no weapons on the colony besides that andrews doesnt believe her story and confines her to the infirmary until the rescue team arrivesripley refuses to recount her story to clemens out of fear of being written off as crazy herself golic seems to be raving mad quoting that in an insane world a sane man must appear insane much to clemens derision ripley asks clemens about the barcode on the back of his head clemens admits that he was a former prisoner on fiorina sentenced there after a morphine addiction and a bad medical decision caused several deaths when the prison was turned into a lead shielding factory and the population reduced he decided to stay with the inmates knowing no one else would hire him as a doctor ever again happy with his sincerity ripley gives her trust to clemens but the alien suddenly appears in the infirmary emerging from a ventilation shaft it immediately kills clemens and advances on ripley cornering her against a wall for one terrifying moment it seems to examine her pressing itself right up against her cheek but instead it retreats and takes the body of clemens with it golic gazes in awe and admiration of the creature ripley bolts and rushes to the others who are all congregated in the mess hall dillon once again initiates a prayer in which he vents his anger about the recent deaths and reprimands his brothers for the nearrape of ripley andrews tries to prevent rumours by presenting his facts he tells the inmates that murphy got killed by his own carelessness and that boggs and rains are missing presumable killed by a deranged golic dillon begrudgingly hears the story andrews requests several volunteers to organise a search party for the missing inmates suddenly ripley dashes in warning that the alien is here andrews tries to silence her and orders for her to be dragged back to the infirmary but is suddenly snatched through a vent above him right in front of all the prisoners the vent drips with blood afterwardsas one of the inmates wipes the floor the rest of the group congregates in the assembly area dillon agin leads a prayer convnced that the group is now being tested by god for their sins now that there can be no question about whether or not they are in danger the prisoners attempt to deal with their situation aaron feels he is andrews most logical successor but the prisoners seem to hold him in poor regard by calling him 85 and nobody takes him seriously as leader ripley informs the prisoners what she knows about the alien although this one is definitely different from the others she has seen she remembers that the others were only afraid of fire however the absence of anything close to weapons or a surveillance system in the prison creates considerable tension amongst the prisoners prisoner morse danny webb even blames ripley for bringing the alien with her suggesting they should kill her ripley says shes okay with that finally dillon restores the peace with his natural leadership even though he doesnt want to be a leaderan inspection of the floor plan shows that there is a large system of tunnels and a toxic waste containment unit that can be completely sealed off there are also barrels of highly combustible material left behind in the colony eventually they come up with a plan they will use this material to burn the alien out of the tunnels at which point they will force it into the containment unit and trap it indefinitely ripley makes an inspection with an inmate where she learns that aarons nickname 85 came from his file which stated it is his iq the inmates start making preparations by mopping the tunnel with the fuel some of them start searching for working batteries for the flashlight while others start working in the narrow tunnels dillon notices that ripley is unwell seemingly missing doctor clemens unfortunately the plan backfires when the alien attacks one of the inmates before they can finish he drops a candle which ignites the fuel and the explosions happen too soon many prisoners get trapped in the burning tunnels and their numbers are drastically reduced dillon asks one of the prisoners to activate the sprinkler system while ripley helps two of the injured people they appear to be two of the man from the rape attempt unexpectedly the plan to flush out the alien works the creature suddenly emerges in the tunnel blocked at one end by a large group including ripley and dillon and on the other end by prisoner junior holt mccallany he runs to the chamber taunting the alien to follow him the door is shut and junior can be heard screaming inside as the creature kills him after the creature is contained dillon activates the sprinkler system extinguishing the fires they then move through the tunnels collecting their dead comradesdillon holds a sermon commemorating the dead inmates as ripley and aaron discuss what will happen next aaron mentions that the company will come and kill the alien he also mentions that the company has designated ripley as top priority in the meanwhile golic is guarded by morse in the infirmary he succeeds in convincing morse to let him out of his straight jacket since he was innocent of killing boggs and rains anyway golic briefly states his intention to free the alien before knocking out morse and leavesripley and aaron send a communication to the weylandyutani network informing them that they have trapped the alien and request permission to kill it a message returns immediately stating that a rescue team is on its way and their request for termination is denied golic arrives at the containment chamber and tells arthur deobia oparei who is standing guard that he needs to see the beast arthur refuses as the alien would certainly kill him and escape golic suddenly lashes out with a razor and slashes arthurs throat while lamenting what he did he enters the chamber and asks the creature what to do next a shadow closes in on him and moments later the alien is seen running out into the tunnel systemripley confronts dillon with her suspicion that the company will not kill the alien but intends to take the creature with them although she is not concerned with what happens to the company people she fears the creature will escape and spread to other worlds afterwards dillon says that he and his friends are outcasts and can no longer be concerned what happens to the rest of humanity they are interrupted by morse coming in with bad news they go to the containment chamber and find it empty with both arthur and golic dead after the fire dies out a tour through the tunnel identifies 10 dead inmates aaron scolds morse for his illfated decision to release golic with options seemingly running out aaron and morse argue about what to do until dillon ceases their unproductive bickering ripley suffers pains in her chest and suspects internal bleeding aaron helps her with the biomedical scanner in the wrecked eev where they find something worse it was ripley who was impregnated by the facehugger in the sulaco and she is carrying an alien embryo even worse the embryo is a queen and therefore capable of replicating the entire alien colonydillon has gathered the inmates in the assembly area again updating them on the current state of affairs he suggests staying in the assembly area as it has no ducts so the alien could only come through the door the prisoners argue that since they have no weapons of relevance they would be trapped there with no way to defend themselves morse lights a match for his cigarette this sparks a sudden realization that the aliens only fear is fire immediately the group moves towards the much safer furnace area where they heat will hopefully keep the alien outripley suspects that weylandyutani knows about the alien embryo already she asks aaron to send a message to the company stating that the whole base has gone toxic and they should stay away aaron asks why as he is still under the impression that the company will come to kill off the creature ripley warns him that if the company arrives they will take the alien for their own purposes just like theyve always wanted to do even worse they could get hold of the queen she is carrying and the whole of humanity will be in grave danger however aaron doesnt believe her story he wants the company to come as his job on the colony is done so they can take him home to his wife and child although stating that he likes ripley and it is nothing personal aaron refuses to send the messageknowing that she herself is doomed ripley seeks out the alien in the basement of the complex hoping it will kill her she locates the beast and attacks it with a rod but she finds out that she mistook a rusty pipe for the aliens head immediately the alien appears behind her from an overhead space and lands in front of herdillon is in the cell complex when he is startled by ripleys sudden appearance ripley tells him that she sought out the alien but it refused to harm her it can somehow sense that she is carrying the queen which is why it did not kill her in the infirmary earlier since she does not want the queen to fall into company hands and knowing that she can never survive the queens birthing she asks dillon to kill her he agrees to do it and prepares to give ripley a fatal blow with a fire axe however he has a lastsecond chance of heart he refuses to kill ripley over her objections stating that it would be a defeat to kill her now with the adult alien still running around killing people instead the fact that the alien will not kill ripley may be used to the groups advantage dillon promises to give ripley a quick and painless death as soon as the creature is deadthe group congregates in the furnace dillon and ripleys plan is to fire up the blast furnace lure the alien into the mold and drown it in hot lead the prisoners will act as bait rushing down the corridors of the lead works closing off all the entrances until the alien is forced into the mold initially the plan is not met with much enthusiasm some prisoners and aaron still believe that the company plans to rescue them by killing the alien for them ripley tells them about the two previous encounters with the alien and how the company relentlessly sacrificed its crew to obtain the creature dillon finally convinces the others that it is better to go down fighting than die begging on ones knees and it may be their first step toward heaven aaron still dismisses the plan as foolish and returns to the top floor to wait for the company crewripley and dillon inspect the piston of the leadworks since it has not been used for 5 years it is not certain whether it will work ripley will pull the lever to activate the piston that will trap the alien in the mold but there will only be one chance to do this as the machinery cannot be reset a few of the inmates discuss dillons promise of a place in heaven and decide that they should try anyway prisoner david pete postlethwaite starts to have second thoughts about running around in the leadworks while being chased by an alien morse yells that the door he is supposed to close in no longer working a distant scream signals the beginning of the chase several inmates successfully lure the alien through the corridors towards the mold however the mazelike design of the leadworks causes a lot of confusion several inmates find the remains of their friends and some get so lost that they end up back at the piston one prisoner unexpectedly runs into the alien and gets killedin the meanwhile a company ship is nearing the planet the prisoners try to stick to the plan but in the confusion some unexpectedly bump into each other david pete postlethwaite successfully traps the alien but it backtracks corners and kills him when the beast finally crosses the mold ripley hastily prevents eric niall buggy from activating the piston in a panic dillon enters the tunnels and finds kevin philip davis in the clutches of the alien he pulls him away luring the alien with them back towards the mold kevin dies but the alien does not take the bait he does not enter the mold but instead grabs kevins body and pulls it back into the tunnel eric again panics and activates the piston meaning they have only five minutes to get the alien back into the mold before the piston shuts it off prisoner jude vincenzo nicoli makes an attempt but the alien grabs him before they can enter the mold meanwhile the company ship has landed and several people enter the complex aaron receives them one man immediately asks about ripley aaron explains she is in the furnace a man with sunglasses enters followed by a group of people with a steel cage for the beastmorse runs through a tunnel bumping into gregor peter guinness they joke about the scare it gave them but the alien uses their lapse in attention to grab and kill gregor ripley having found two more dead inmates enters the tunnel sends morse out and taunts the alien to follow her together with dillon she finally lures the alien into the piston morse closes the last door finally trapping the beast in the mold and runs back up to man the lead platform ripley intends to stay in the mold as she intends to die anyway but dillon pulls her with him stating her promise that the alien should die before ripley they both climb up but notice the alien is following them up as well dillon decides to stay in the mold to keep the alien there comforting ripley that god will take care of her now dillon sacrifices himself by wrestling with the alien in the mold ripley climbs out and as dillons final cry echoes morse dumps the lead on ripleys command completely submerging the creature morse cheers but the lead fails to kill the alien as it bursts out of the mold now enraged it makes for ripley who climbs a series of chains to get away from it but it begins to scramble up after her suddenly morse shouts to ripley and reminds her of the sprinkler system hanging above her ripley triggers it and dumps cold water over the alien the sudden cooling immediately causes cracks and breaks to appear over the alien until it finally explodesripley climbs up onto morses platform which hovers above the furnace when she looks up she is confronted by aaron who brought the company medics and soldiers the man with the sunglasses moves to the front and ripley recognizes him as bishop lance henriksen he speaks soothingly to her and tells her that he is not the bishop android but rather its human designer sent by the company to ensure ripleys safe return he tells her that the medic team is there to remove the embryo from her in a simple surgical procedure that will save her life ripley asks him what they intend to do with the alien embryo once it is removed and bishop ii promises her that they will destroy it as its cannot be allowed to live ripley however will be unconscious so she will have to trust them ripley gives it some thought but she knows that the company really cant be trusted she closes the fence that separates morse and herself from the rest of them morse moves the platform away from the others and one of the soldiers immediately shoots him in the leg in response aaron hits bishop ii in the back with a lead pipe the soldiers lethally shoot aaron bishop ii wounded and dazed yells that he is not a droid as red blood gushes from his wound begs ripley not to ruin his chances for studying the alien its a magnificent specimen you must let me have it he shouts at her ripley asks morse to help her one more time and he moves the platform out over the boiling blast furnace walking to the edge she summons up her strength and drops herself backwards into the furnace taking her own life on the way down the queen alien erupts from her chest but ripley holds tightly onto it dragging it with her into the furnace ripleys body is finally immersed in the flamesemptyhanded the company medics bandage morses wound and take him along with them when they leave abandoning the penal colony on fiorina 161 during a final pass by the crashed eev we hear the radio picking up ripleys final transmission from the end of the first movie decades before this is ripley last survivor of the nostromo signing off a final company message screen shows that the fury 161 colony is to be closed and its equipment sold as
