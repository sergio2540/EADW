bond james kelly billy nelson john savoca the defense and the prosecution have rested and the jury is filing into the jury room to decide if a young spanishamerican is guilty or innocent of murdering his father what begins as an open and shut case of murder soon becomes a minidrama of each of the jurors prejudices and preconceptions about the trial the accused and each other based on the play all of the action takes place on the stage of the jury room 12 angry men focuses on a jurys deliberations in a capital murder case a 12man jury is sent to begin deliberations in the firstdegree murder trial of an 18yearold latino accused in the stabbing death of his father where a guilty verdict means an automatic death sentence the case appears to be openandshut the defendant has a weak alibi a knife he claimed to have lost is found at the murder scene and several witnesses either heard screaming saw the killing or the boy fleeing the scene eleven of the jurors immediately vote guilty only juror no 8 mr davis casts a not guilty vote at first mr davis bases his vote more so for the sake of discussion after all the jurors must believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty as the deliberations unfold the story quickly becomes a study of the jurors complex personalities which range from wise bright and empathetic to arrogant prejudiced and merciless preconceptions backgrounds and interactions that provides the backdrop to mr davis attempts in convincing the other jurors that a not guilty verdict might be appropriate a teenaged hispanic boy has just been tried for the murder of his father and the case is now in the hands of the jury a guilty verdict will send the boy to the electric chairthe case looks on the surface cut and dried but juror number 8 henry fonda despite believing that the defendant is probably guilty feels that the facts merit a cursory review before the jury hands in a guilty verdict his insistence on a brief examination of the case seems to rub many on the jury the wrong way as they continue to see the matter as open and shutfascinatingly as they examine the testimony and facts of the case the experiences personalities limitations and biases of the jurors weave in and out of the deliberation process at times to its benefit and at times to its detrimentto the benefit of the deliberation process 1 the very elderly juror joseph sweeney is the only one who can see a possible motive explaining why an elderly witness may have misled the court in his testimony 2 the one fellow jack klugman who grew up in a rough neighborhood where he witnessed numerous knife fights is the only one who sees a problem in assuming that the defendant made the stab wound found and 3 the juror who had done contract work by the elevated subway edward binns was the only one in a position to question what one of the witnesses might or might not have heardto the detriment of the deliberation process 1 one juror ed begley is so consumed by his personal prejudices that he sees value in ridding the streets of the hispanic defendant whether or not he is guilty and 2 another juror number 3 lee j cobb is impervious to reason because he has been physically harmed by his teenage son and consequently views every teenage boy including the defendant as capable of patricidethe number of obstacles on the path to honest assessment of the facts is a constant threat to the deliberation process if the jury fails to unanimously agree on a verdict of either guilty or not guilty it will become a hung jury a jury that cannot reach a decision and must retire from the case without declaring a verdict watching how this matter is resolved is a riveting study in the nature and ultimate beauty of the trial by jury processone by one the jurors change their minds and decide the boy is not guilty juror number 3 the man at odds with his teenaged son is the last one to change his mind the jurors at last are able to vote unanimously for acquittal as the jurors leave the court building juror number 8 and juror number 9 the elderly man introduce themselves to each other as davis and mcardle respectively mcardle says so long as he takes leave of davis knowing that they will never meet again that their lives had crossed only for a single purpose 8.9jury murder trial jury room prejudice doubt discussion
