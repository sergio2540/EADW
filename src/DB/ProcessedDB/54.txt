1967 in motaba river valley zaire a virus with a 100 mortality rate starts infecting people the virus becomes known as the motaba virus and its so deadly that it causes severe bleeding and liquefies internal organs killing within 3 days the virus wipes out motaba river valley and a devastatingly huge fire bomb is dropped onto motaba river valley in order to reduce the chances of further infection the bomb was dropped on the orders of corrupt general donald mcclintock even though an army surgeon general bill ford was against the idea 27 years later in 1994 there is another outbreak in motaba river valley at the united states army medical research institute of infectious diseases usamriid located at fort detrick in maryland colonel sam daniels is doing research on the motaba virus and so is his exwife roberta keough who works at the center for disease control and prevention cdc in atlanta georgia a monkey carrying the motaba virus stows away on a ship that is heading for the usa and after the monkeys arrival people in cedar creek california start becoming infected by the virus sam and roberta head into cedar creek with fellow doctor casey schuler and they start searching for the monkey thinking that the monkey is the key to finding a cure along the way sam stumbles onto some information that may be of help  mcclintock has been concealing vital information from the president of the united states since 1967 mcclintock and ford have been in possession of e1101 a serum that was made to cure the virus mcclintock has been trying to stop ford from coming forward with this information and so far mcclintock has succeeded mcclintock now wants to drop onto cedar creek the kind of firebomb that was dropped on motaba river valley 27 years ago sam and roberta figure out that the virus in the cedar creek outbreak is a new strain of the motaba virus  an airborne strain that is even more contagious than the flu when a new serum is made to stop the new strain sam and roberta set out to stop mcclintock from having the town blown up a deadly airborne virus finds its way into the usa and starts killing off people at an epidemic rate col sam daniels job is to stop the virus spreading from a small town which must be quarantined and to prevent an over reaction by the white house a lethal virus is transported to the united states via an african monkey host the us army medical research institute for infections diseases and the centre for disease control are two federal agencies headed by an exhusband and his former wife rush to stop its deadly spread will they succeed when a disease in africa is discovered colonel sam daniels of the united states army medical research institute for infectious diseases or usamriid is sent to investigate when he reports back to his superior officer general ford and tells him that they should put out an alert on this disease but the general that since the disease is so far away and not airborne that it cant possibly reach the us however a monkey from that part of africa was captured and brought to the us and a man who works at the customs house took it and tried to sell it but when the person he tried to sell it to rejected it he released it later the man who arrived in boston collapses and dies col daniels wants to look into it but general ford denies his request so he turns to his exwife who works at the center for disease control or cdc to look into and they discover its the african disease but since it kills very quickly col daniels feels that its been contained until another outbreak a virus similar to ebola  lassa is discovered in africa in 1969 25 years later it resurfaces  and col sam daniels of the us army is sent in to investigate it when he returns he warns his boss brigadiergen ford of the lethal nature of the virus and wants to put out an alert ford who had been one of the men who first dealt with the virus insists the virus is contained and unlikely to show up in the us what neither man knows is that the host  a monkey  has been brought into the us by freighter through an underthetable bribe a young man gets the monkey out of the animaltesting lab it was bound for soon the man is infected  and col daniels exwife dr keough  now with the cdc  is called into boston when the young man is brought to a hospital in critical condition dr keough discovers that the man has died from the virus and at the same time  on the other side of the country  a new outbreak is starting in a little california town a quarantine is set up to stop the virus from spreading while fords boss the sinister majorgen mcclintock has his own agenda in mind  to harness this lethal bug for use as a bioweapon with the president about to order a fuelair bomb to be dropped on the little town to stop the outbreak daniels must find a way to unravel mcclintocks sinister plan in 1967 a squad of military investigators in full nbc suits examine an african village where many are dead or dying they depart in a helicopter and shortly after a plane flies toward the village and drops a fuel air bomb and immolates the entire area white faced monkeys scurry offinside a high security lab
