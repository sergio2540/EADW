chase jazzborne monty jordan scott krambeck kate romero wendy wellsgunkel maverick is a hot pilot when he encounters a pair of migs over the persian gulf his wingman is clearly outflown and freaks on almost no fuel maverick is able to talk him back down to the carrier when his wingman turns in his wings maverick is moved up in the standings and sent to the top gun naval flying school there he fights the attitudes of the other pilots and an old story of his fathers death in combat that killed others due to his fathers error maverick struggles to be the best pilot stepping on the toes of his other students and in a different way to charlie a civilian instructor to whom he is strongly attracted the aircraft carrier enterprise is on patrol near the persian gulf when radar contact is made with a mig fighter the combat air patrol of the enterprise is vectored to meet the incoming aircraft and the fighters involved are f14 tomcat interceptors each manned by a pilot and a radar intercept officer the pilot of the lead plane is flight lieutenant peter maverick mitchell tom cruise a callsign appropriate for his arrogant rulebending attitude his rio is lt nicholas goose bradshaw anthony edwards the second f14 is piloted by bill cougar cortell john stockwell with sam merlin wells tim robbins as the rio the two f14s split up and are surprised when a second mig shielded from radar by riding within feet of its leader appears cougar is outmaneuvered by mig one while maverick locks his missile radar on mig two who promptly disengages mig one stays on cougar and is only chased off when maverick flies upside down closes up on the mig and flashes an obscene gesture to the enemy pilot the mig disengages and the two tomcats fly to the enterprise but cougar is so rattled he cannot land forcing maverick low on fuel and against orders to abort his own landing and talk cougar to the deckcougar sees the captain of the enterprise tom stinger jordan james tolkan and turns in his wings this forces stinger to change his intended disciplinary action against maverick for he must send a tomcat tandem for additional combat training at the navys fighter weapons school in miramar ca near san diego and the captain is disgusted that maverick is the only qualified candidate for the assignmentmaverick however is quietly overjoyed as he regards the assignment as an opportunity and upon arrival begins to build a rivalry with a fellow tomcat pilot lt tom iceman kazansky val kilmer and his rio ron slider kerner rick rossovich at a bar the night after their first day at the school maverick notices charlotte blackwood kelly mcgillis a pretty young blonde in jeans and hits on her by following her into the ladies room and serenading her it seems not to work until the next day she appears at the school revealing herself to be charlie a previously unseen dod flight instructor that maverick had assumed to be male though technically a civilian she has mastered the flight simulator where she has beaten several actual pilots she begins to become smitten with maverick before the official competition beginsin his first exercise maverick takes on the schools resident enemy pilot ltc richard jester heatherly michael ironside and succeeds in outmaneuvering him and shooting him down but in so doing he flies below a set minimum engagement altitude  a harddeck  and then compounds this faux pax by overflying a flight tower at absurdly low altitude just to show himself officeman chews out maverick for his unsafe attitude but maverick refuses to have any of it even after the schools leader commander michael viper metcalf tom skerritt summons him to his office and threatens to expel him should he continue this way metcalf however knows maverick for mavericks father flew with him in vietnam and was shot down when he engaged the enemy in neutral airspacethe contest between maverick and iceman continues in a later exercise viper and jester team up against maverick and fellow f14 pilot hollywood maverick breaks a cardinal rule by abandoning his wingman to go after viper and in so doing hollywood is shot down and then the same fate befalls maverickbut the worst is yet to come for maverick is teamed with iceman and maverick determined to win the school contest angrilly chews out iceman for taking too long to attack an enemy craft maverick takes the shot but when the two aircraft get close the backwash from icemans thrusters cripple mavericks engines and the f14 plunges toward the sea goose barely succeeds in yanking open the emergency ejection handles but when the fighters canopy pops open the two pilots eject and goose crashes into the canopy killing himmaverick is devastated by gooses death and though an inquiry clears him of wrongdoing his confidence is destroyed he nonetheless graduates from the class and is reassigned to the enterprise where an incident with enemy migs leads to a fateful battle involving iceman as well as maverick iceman and hollywood are launched to intercept a pair of migs but are jumped by four additional enemy fighters hollywood is shot down and iceman hopelessly surrounded when maverick is launched now with merlin as his rio maverick quickly arrives at the scene of battle but is surrounded by enemy and when he flies into one ships jetwash his own fighter briefly stalls out  and though he regains control he flashes back to gooses death and breaks off leaving iceman who has long doubted mavericks courage after gooses death trapped as merlin desperately and furiously yells at maverick to get back into battle maverick pull himself together and returns to assist iceman and they destroy four migs prompting the remaining squadron to retreat with this maverick and iceman finally become friends as a reward for his heroism maverick is offered any assignment he chooses he chooses to be an instructor at top gun he tosses gooses dog tags into the ocean signifying he has come to terms with his friends death
