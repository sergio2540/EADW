is an unknown killer of girls he whistles edvard griegs in the hall of the mountain king from the peer gynt suite i op 46 while attracting the little girls for death the police force pressed by the minister give its best effort trying unsuccessfully to arrest the serial killer the organized crime has great losses due to the intense search and siege of the police and decides to chase the murderer with the support of the beggars association they catch hans and briefly judge him there have been a rash of child abductions and murders in berlin the murderer lures the children into his confidence by candy and other such child friendly items everyone is on edge because the murderer has not been caught the most substantial pieces of evidence the police have are hand written letters by the murderer which he sent to the newspaper for publication unknown even to himself a blind beggar who sold the murderer a balloon for one of the child victims may have key information as to the murderers identity the murder squads work is made even more difficult with the large number of tips they receive from the paranoid public who are quick to accuse anyone of suspicious activity solely for their own piece of mind that someone  anyone  is apprehended for the heinous crimes conversely many want to take the case into their own hands including the towns leading criminals since the increased police presence has placed a strain on their ability to conduct criminal activity although they both have the same end goal of capturing the murderer the police and the criminals seem to be working at cross purposes which may provide an edge to the murderer in getting away a psychotic child murderer stalks a city and despite an exhaustive investigation fueled by public hysteria and outcry the police have been unable to find him but the police crackdown does have one sideaffect it makes it nearly impossible for the organized criminal underground to operate so they decide that the only way to get the police off their backs is to catch the murderer themselves besides he is giving them a bad name its noon concerned parents are lined up outside the schools waiting to escort their kids home for lunch signs along the street ask wer ist der morder who is the murderer of eight children killed over the past year little elsie beckmann inge landgut has just become victim number ninewho is the murderer it could be anyone the viewer knows that it is hans beckert peter lorre neighbors are turning in neighbors and fingering strangers in the street just for talking to a child the police are on the job 24 hours a day but all they have turned up so far is some ariston cigarette butts some sugar grains and a bag that held candy they have investigated over 1500 clues and have compiled 60 volumes of documents every thicket every bush every hole in the area has been combed every place from flop houses to underworld hangouts are being raided every nightin fact the police investigation has been so thorough that the underground is getting worried about the shakedowns underworld boss schränker gustaf gründgens has come to the conclusion that the child killer must be found before the police ruin business after a lengthy discussion with all the underworld bosses in attendance there is a wonderful scenario where the underworld bosses discuss strategies while the police do the same such that it hard to tell the difference between gangsters and police they decide that the best solution is to monitor all children at all times and that the best persons to do that the only ones who can be seen on the streets without arousing suspicions are beggars so every street has its beggar sitting in a doorway having a smoke on the corner watching the children and noting anyone following or with a childa break comes in the person of a blind balloon peddlar georg john who hears a man whistling a tune and remembers the same tune being whistled by a man who purchased a balloon on the day elsie beckmann was murdered he alerts his blocks beggar who follows the beckert who is leading a little girl into a candy store when beckert makes the mistake of throwing an orange peel on the sidewalk the beggar pretends to slip on it and while clutching beckert for support he transfers onto the back of beckerts shoulder a big m that he previously chalked on his palm the beggars are now able to follow the man with the m on his coatmeanwhile the police have been attempting to trace the origin of a postcard sent by the child killer to the local newspaper while investigating released criminals and mental patients that fit the profile of the killer lazy indolent and of strong and pathological sexuality the police come to hans beckerts apartment beckert isnt home but the landlady shows them in searching beckerts room they find some ariston cigarettes and a red pencil the likes of which was used to write the postcard certain that beckert is the killer the police lay in wait for beckert to returnbut beckert is on the make the little girl that he is with suddenly notices the m on his shoulder and offers to wipe it off certain that he has been caught beckert runs into an office building the beggars contact schränker who sends a group of gangsters to comb the building and capture the child killer unfortunately the night watchman sounds an alarm alerting the police in the minutes before the police arrive the gangsters find beckert and everyone except for burglar franz friedrich gnass manages to get out before the police arrive to make franz sing detective lohmann lies to him that the night watchman at the building was killed during the gangsters raid the strategy has the desired effect fearing that he is going to face a murder rap franz tells how the gangsters have captured the child killer and taken him to an abandoned distillery to stand trialmeanwhile in the basement of the abandoned distillery a kangaroo court is in session comprising of the leaders and the members of the various criminal organizations when beckert explains to schränker that he is driven by a voice and an evil impulse he cant control it is voted to eliminate him so that there is no chance of him ever getting free to murder another child only beckerts appointed defense counsel rudolf blumner argues that since beckert is driven by an uncontrollable impulse he cannot be held responsible for his actions and should be turned over to the police so that the state can render him harmless at that moment the police enter the distillery and escort beckert awayepilogue as beckerts real trial progresses the mothers of the slain children listen to the verdict the ultimate and final comment comes from frau beckmann ellen widmann who says that none of this will bring back the children and that mothers must keep a closer watch over them original synopsis by bjkuehl 8.5police criminal murder killer beggar letter balloon serial-killer blind-beggar investigation
