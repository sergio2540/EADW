as adolf hitler had the right idea and the holocaust cant be proven the evening takes a turn for the worse with zack threatening the group putting a knife to marcs throat and breaking petes arm after pete tries to threaten him marc kills zack by stabbing him in the back and the group decides to cover up the murderafter a long discussion led by luke the students decide to continue killing people with conservative views in order to make the world a better place the initial horror of the event soon turns to intrigue amongst the housemates who have numerous discussions on the implications of what they have done whilst debating different views of their actions of many bottles of wine and digressing to problems of the world and politics they discuss different methods of murder and settle on poison as being their first method used for the next case after zackthe students lay down a procedure for each murder the guest will be given every opportunity to change their mind and recant their beliefs if the guests fail to change their ways by dessert the group offers them poisoned white wine from a blue decanter and raises a toast the bodies are buried in the groups vegetable gardenthe following night the group invites the local priest charles durning for dinner and lace a blue wine carafe with poison and reserve it for the priests glass while the green wine carafe is for them their previous discussions on good versus evil and mans right to serve judgement are to be played out the priests strong views on homosexuality and aids only serve to villify the housemates and justify their intended action the priest eats his fill at the table and drinks deeply before beginning to feel ill from the effects of the poison the housemates look on in mock horror and fascination whilst the priest breathes his lastpaulie feels guilty about what they have done but the others console her and justify it based on the priests strong opinions on certain topics that disagree with the views of the housemates who go on to finish dinner with the priest still slumped at the top of the table suddenly marc begins to cough and act as though he is poisoned too but it turns out to be a joke on the other housematestheir next dinner guest is a man mark harmon with strong sexist opinions who considers rape to be a false state of mind and thinks that men are entitled to their position of superiority the guest drinks from the poisoned blue chalice and soon begins to feel the effects to the amusement of the housemates before he is buried in the garden alongside the priestthe film cuts

the garden as they benefit from the added nutrients and jude takes to caring for the garden and paulie makes chutney from the fruita environmentalist is the next victim jason alexander who after sharing his strong opinions on global warming drinks from the poisoned blue bottle and the results are inevitable following that is a neonazi rick lawrence and then an illegal alien hater amy hillmeanwhile the sheriff is stepping up her inquiries and reveals to one day pete that she has also found zacks abandoned pickup truck in the woods zack is a known felon and pete feigns shock when she tells him that zack is a suspected serial killer but pete denies knowing who zack is and does not identify him from a series of photographs shown to him by the sheriffthe housemates discuss their progress and the next guest a librarian pamela gien is invited to dinner but the meal is interrupted with a knock at the door the sheriff has made a house call and gets marc to reluctantly open the door she is asking about the missing girl named jenny tyler and shows marc the same photographs that she had earlier shown pete paulie joins them at the door flicks through the photographs and denies knowing any of them even though the picture of zack is included while they are at the door there is a crash in the background that the sheriff hears presumed to be the librarian collapsing pete rushes to the door to cover and meets the sheriff again they make small talk to distract the sheriff who eventually leaves but pauses in the pathway suspicious on the students nervous behavior when the housemates return to the dinner table they find jude in a panic because she has had to stab the librarian because she was a teetotaller and didnt drink the wine a discussion ensues where the housemates try to justify their killing of zack given his criminal past with them declaring that they have prevented other deaths by killing him they then argue over their body count to date and excuse their actions based on their opinions of their victims and their strong views declaring that they have saved societyafter ten murders misgivings begin to surface within the group as a couple of them grow indecisive regarding the justification of their actions their next dinner party guest is a young teenage girl called heather bryn erin who has strong opinions for her age on her human rights and family values and an opponent of mandatory sex education in school her opinions quickly anger the housemates and luke takes a particular dislike to her with the other housemates arguing amongst themselves jude eventually comes to heathers rescue and accompanies her out of the house and she makes a lucky escapethe next day the sheriff secretly arrives outside the students house and peers through the garden fence she overbears jude and luke argue over the tending of the garden and tomato plants and tensions are highthe sheriff scales the fence to get a closer look when she thinks that jude and luke have gone back inside but gets caught creeping around the garden by luke who kills her with a blow to the head with a shovela few days later pete and luke head to the airport for spring break but their flight is delayed by coidence they see dr norman arbuthnot in the departure lounge and approach him to introduce themselves throughout the movie brief segments of radical statements made by arbuthnot had been appearing on the tv that the group had been watching in their home they invite him back to their house for dinner and prepare the intended blue bottle poisoned solution but allow him to drink from an alternative green bottle at his own selection for the time beingthey go on to debate his views and arbuthnot reveals that his extreme conservative views he shares on television are about gathering high ratings rather than necessarily being his own personal opinions his views turn out to be moderate and reasonable much to the suprise of his five guests arbuthnot reveals that he is actually a fullon liberal and he stymies the group with his moderate and persuasive arguments all of which the usually argumentative group have difficulty debunking he even admits that he says more radically conservative things mostly for attention when he reaches for the blue carafe jude prevents him from drinking from it saying it was left out too long and has gone bad much to lukes horror they continue their debateafter several more minutes of talk arbuthnots responses to the issues of abortion racisim sexed and women are unbias and agreeable out of pure frustration all five confused students one by one suspiciously excuse themselves to the kitchen to determine norman arbuthnots fate leaving the behildered speaker activist alone at the dinner table in their absence arbuthnot goes to fill his glass from the blue bottle but he smells something strange and sets the blue bottle aside thinking that the wine is fermented note prior to him arriving an overzealous marc has made the solution too strong with too much arcenic which would explain an overpowering smell the wine now gives offin the kitchen the five housemates talk over what they should do with arbuthnot since he is really a fairminded liberal like them a quick vote is taken on whether they should kill dr arbuthnot and its 4 to 1 to let him live but luke continues to hold out instisting that he must be killed and even calls arbuthnot hitler for he is a skilled manipulator after a tense altercation luke pulls out a gun and aims it at jude luke confesses to killing the sheriff a few days ago who until now the other housemates did not know had been killed in their back yardback in the dining room a curious dr arbuthnot looks around at the various things in the dining room after a few minutes he casually takes the time to light himself a cigar when he spots the ten freshly dug mounds in the rainy back garden when the lights in the room flicker for a few seconds from the storm outside arbuthnot then picks up and reads a discarded newspaper lying on the couch which has a headling on the missing sheriff norman arbuthnot looks towards the strong smelling blue bottle and then back at the ten mounds of dirt outside in the pouring rain and then back at the blue bottle he begins to put two and two togetherin the kitchen jude dials 911 and luke points the gun at her but jude is placed on hold by the police department so she hangs up luke breaks down and the house mates console him before rejoining dr norman arbuthnot in the dining room arbuthnot presents the group with glasses of wine and offers them a toast but does not drink himself with the excuse that he doesnt want to be too intoxicated to fly his private planethe film closes with the image of a painting showing five dead dinner party hosts and the voice of the dr arbuthnot the presumption being that he had filled their glasses from the blue bottle after realizing their deeds and delivering his own form of justice as
