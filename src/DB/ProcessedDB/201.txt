woods possessing him fortunately the sun comes up and drives away the kandarian demon leaving ash perfectly healthy if not a little depressedat this point ash bravely clambers into his oldsmobile and makes a dash for freedom only to find that the bridge is now destroyed presumably by evil forces yet again the evil pursues him to the cabin and then through it but ash using all his cunning evades itfollowing a manly nap our lovable coward wakes in an armchair to piano music looking outside he sees lindas corpse reanimate ted raimi and dance she then vanishes and her head appears in ashs lap biting hard on his right hand unable to remove the head he rushes to the workshed and puts it in a vice causing it to release its grip and instead starts to mock mr williams who has already had a trying day to make matters worse the headless torso charges into the shed and attacks ash with a chainsaw yet again blind luck saves ash and he defeats the body and uses the chainsaw to destroy lindas head this time shes obviously got on ashs bad side as she gets no further burialupon returning to the cabin with a shotgun ash is further frightened by an unseen entity moaning on the rocking chair dropping the shotgun he tries to console himself by telling his reflection in the mirror that everything is fine however his reflection suddenly comes to life and contradicts him laughing at ashs predicament and then throttling ash before vanishingcontinuing this luckless night ashs hand has seemingly became possessed and starts attacking ash with plates knocking him unconscious it then spots a cleaver and starts to drag ashs unconscious body towards it but ash wakes up stabs his own hand and hacks it off with the very chainsaw he used only moments ago to hack his lover to pieceshe traps his amputated hand in a tin but it escapes and hides inside the wall ash fires several shells into the wall in an attempt to kill it and the walls begin to bleed spraying ash and covering the entire room in blood suddenly the blood vanishes back into the walls and ash falls backwards into a chair that breaks under his weight a deer head mounted on the wall suddenly begins to laugh at ash and other items in the house such as lamps cabinets and books join in ash who appears to be losing his sanity laughs along with them the laughter ends abruptly when ash hears movement outside the front doorthe people at the door are annie knowby prof knowbys daughter sarah berry who has pages of the necronomicon with her boyfriend ed gentley richard domeierwhos not really important as hell be hacked to pieces within 15 minutes and their two red neck guides jake dan hicks and bobbie jo kassie wesley depaiva ash shoots through the door clearly on his last nerve this result in grazing bobby jo ed and jake restrain ash as annie notices the absence of her parents in the cabin after seeing the blood on the chainsaw and on ash they come to the conclusion that he killed annies parents the four newcomers throw ash into the fruit cellarannie ed jake and bobby jo listen to recordings of professor knowbys where they learn that knowby killed henrietta lou hancock annies mother after she became possessed and buried her body in the fruit cellar surprisingly henrietta then rises from the grave and attacks the luckless ash the other four take pity on him and release him from his basement prison and force the demon wife into the cellar although this procedure results in bobby jo getting a mouthful of eye ball fortunately henrietta is locked undergroundbut thats not this demon done yet it takes human form and tries to persuade annie to let it out thats right shes a crafty kandarian demon ash sees through this trick grabs annie and shakes his head this sheer act of manliness overwhelms annie and makes her say that thing in the cellar is not my mother at this point it becomes apparent that ed too has rudely became possessed and even more rudely takes a bite out of bobby jos hair and tells them all that they will be dead by dawn ash appears to flee at this point and receives a shouting from anniebut low and behold our hero has not fled and as the others have been frozen with fear ash returns brandishing an axe he hacks ed to pieces told you and casually explains their predicament to the othersfollowing some unconvincing sound affects the spirit of the professor appears before ash and the others telling them that the pages annie possesses are the key to dispelling the evil dead bobby jo then discovers ashs possessed hand holding hers and she runs into the forest where she is attacked and killed by the trees annie and ash find a drawing in the book depicting a hero said to have dispelled the evil the hero appears as a figure with a chainsawlike hand and a boomstick hysterical with fear for bobby jo jake picks up the shotgun and forces everyone to go after her ash tries to convince jake that bobby jo is dead but jake grows furious and throws the book pages into the cellar the group goes into the woods only to discover that the trail has disappeared a demon rushes them again possessing ash and throws jake into a tree ash chases annie back to the cabin she grabs the bone dagger from the first movie and accidentally stabs jake as he is trying to get back into the cabinshe pulls jakes body inside and shuts the door ash pounds on the door then suddenly stops annie removes the dagger from jake and then drags him to the cellar door where henrietta attacks and kills him ash attacks annie accidentally ripping her necklace off her neck as she lays unconscious ash looks at the necklace and reverts to his normal self after being reminded of linda after convincing a terrified annie that he is no longer possessed ash and annie agree to vanquish the evil togetherthis calls for an awesome montage as ash uses his technical knowhow to convert the chainsaw into a chainsaw hand fitting firmly on his amputated stump and sawing the end of his shotgun the scene ends up with a close up of his rugged face and he announces groovy this establishes that the previous coward has become a lean mean deadite slaying machineash and annie return to the cabin where ash enters the cellar and finds the pages strewn about the floor seemingly leading him deeper into the darkness henrietta leaps out of the cellar door and attacks annie ash emerges from the cellar and begins fighting with henrietta he has the upper hand until henrietta transforms into a more vicious demonic form ash is saved when annie distracts henrietta by singing a lullaby that henrietta sang to her when she was a girl while henrietta is focused on annie ash uses his chainsaw to decapitate the demon then deals the final blow by delivering a shotgun blast to its head annie takes the pages and begins translating the text to manifest the evil which appears in the form of a large bloody head covered in the faces of those it has possessed while ash fends off the creature annie recites the incantation to rid the earth of the evil a large vortex opens up just outside the cabin gravitating everything around into it including ashs car a large tree and the evil itself annie is then stabbed in the back by ashs severed hand with her dying breaths she speaks the last words of the incantation and ash is sucked into the vortex before it disappearsash suddenly falls from the sky and lands on a large block of rock he looks up and finds himself surrounded by medieval knights the knights are about to attack ash when a winged demonic creature swoops down from the sky terrifying the knights as they scatter ash reaches for his shotgun and blows the creatures head off the knights gather around ash as he prepares to defend himself one knight then lifts his face plate and declares hail he who hath fallen from the sky to deliver us from the terror of the deadites the army of medieval warriors then falls to their knees and begins chanting hail as ash realizes that he is in fact the prophesied hero from the sky the film closes with ash shaking his head in disbelief and screaming no as the camera pans out to show the large army that now awaits ashs command 7.9cabin
