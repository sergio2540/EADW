to write a thesis about local legends and myths she visits a part of the town where she learns about the legend of the candyman a onearmed man who appears when you say his name five times in front of a mirror of course helen doesnt believe all this stuff but the people of the area are really afraid when she ignores their warnings and begins her investigation in the places that he is rumored to appear a series of horrible murders begins could the legend be true in chicago helen lyle and her friend bernadette walsh are researching for their thesis about urban legend in the university of illinois where helens husband trevor lyle gives classes helen becomes obsessed by the legend of the candyman a son of slaves whose father became rich in 1890 after inventing a device for mass producing of shoes the educated candyman was an artist but when the daughter of a powerful man got pregnant of him her father hired some men to kill him the candyman lives in the legend that says that he would appear if his name is spoken five times in front of the mirror and the skeptical helen attempts to summon candyman helen and bernadette go to cabrini green where two unsolved murders had happened and the dwellers blame candyman for the crimes as helen tries to prove his existence helen lyle virginia masden is an affluent young woman who is working with her good friend bernadette bernie walsh kasi lemmons on a masters thesis involving modern folklore her husband trevor lyle xander berkeley is a university professor of whom she suspects infidelity with one of his younger students and we suspect her home life isnt quite satisfying despite the fact that she seems to be very much in love with trevor helen and bernie have been interviewing numerous people about various urban legend type stories one young woman tells them a story about candyman a mythical being who has a hook instead of a right hand the legend goes that candyman will appear behind you if you say his name five times while looking in a mirroras helen reviews the recorded conversation in an empty classroom one night at the university a cleaning woman overhears the story about candyman and remarks on it she calls in another cleaning woman who tells helen about the murders that have taken place in cabrinigreen the low income housing project where she lives the people of cabrinigreen have attributed the deaths to candyman as the victims have been butchered with a weapon determined to be a hook the mention of the murders leads helen to research it in archived newspapers and she finds out the names of the victims even more intriguing to her is the fact that her own apartment building was designed exactly like cabrinigreen she learns that it was intended as another housing development but eventually the idea was scrapped when the developers realized that the location was too desirable helen and bernie theorize that the white developers relocated the housing project to a more forbidding area that would keep the ghetto separated from the rest of the city helen is aware that the units in her building are connected to one another through the medicine chests in the bathrooms when removed they reveal a small space that links the apartments together helen knows that cabrinigreens apartments must be the same and that the stories of candyman coming out of the medicine chest could indicate a human assailant who had also made this discovery with bernadette in tow she visits cabrinigreen and finds the apartment of one of the murder victims on the other side of the medicine chest is a strange lair with holes in the wall and elaborate graffitistyle artwork depicting a large mans head with a hole in the wall for a mouth helen is fascinated by it as well as the fact that an altar appears to have been constructed there as well with candy left behind as an offeringhelen and bernie meet annemarie mccoy vanessa williams the neighbor of the deceased victim annemarie is initially hostile to them as she feels the presence of white people in the allblack housing development indicates nothing but trouble bernie herself is black but helen is white and the tenants they meet on the way inside mistake them for police officers but eventually annemarie softens and invites them into her apartment helen is taken by annemaries baby boy anthony lanesha martin  latesha martin admitting she would like to have a child of her own one day annemarie says that she is determined to make a better life for her son one that does not involve cabrinigreen or the drugdealing youths that loiter on its groundswhile at dinner one night with bernie trevor and a few of trevors colleagues helen makes the mistake of baiting philip purcell michael culkin a snobbish folklore expert by mentioning her thesis project philip attempts to belittle helen by telling her that hes already written an essay about candyman philip shares with her candymans strange back story revealing that he was the son of a slave who had come into a great deal of wealth due to an invention that became hugely successful candyman grew up wellschooled and comfortable and was a prodigious artist who was in high demand among the wealthy to paint their portraits eventually candyman had an affair with the daughters of one of his wealthy white clients and when she became pregnant the man exacted a horrible revenge on candyman he sent hired goons to attack candyman cutting off his right hand stripping him nude and smearing him with the honeycomb of a hive of angry bees he was killed by the numerous bee stings philip claims that it all took place on the site where cabrinigreen now standseven more intrigued helen returns to the building on her own when she finds annemarie is not home she meets a young boy named jake dejuan guy who gives her more information another death in the project was attributed to candyman the brutal castration of a young boy kenneth a brown who entered a filthy public mens room only to meet an attacker who cut off his genitals resulting in his death when jake takes helen to the site she goes inside and starts taking photographs but a group of young toughs enters after her one man terrence riggins approaches her and announces that he is candyman and his is carrying a large hook which he uses to beat helens face knocking her unconscious later in a police lineup she identifies her assailant much to the satisfaction of detective frank valento gilbert lewis who informs helen that the young man who beat her was suspected of the previous murders he had been using the legend of candyman to frighten the residents of cabrinigreen into silence and helens testimony will help to put him away helen meets jake there at the police station and she thanks him for his help explaining that her attacker was human and that candyman is not real jake almost seems disappointedsome time later helen and bernie have a discussion where helen reveals that she is unsettled by the fact that the two murders both of which featured black victims went practically unnoticed while her own mere assault caused a lockdown of cabrinigreen presumably because she was a white victim bernie surprises her with slides from her camera which helen had assumed was a complete writeoff after the attack in the mens room on the way back to her car helen looks at the slides when suddenly she is confronted by a strange figure a tall black man wearing a long coat and speaking in an unearthly voice she realizes this is candyman although she can barely comprehend how it is possible candyman urges helen to become his victim almost as if he were speaking to a lover he tells helen that because she has exposed the real killer at cabrinigreen she has caused a sudden rift in his world the belief in him by hundreds of people is what allows him to go on living helens incident has caused this belief to drop and now he is in danger of ceasing to exist entirely candyman intends to kill helen which would then give rebirth to his legend and cause belief to surge once more helen swoons and loses consciousnesswhen she awakens she is disoriented and realizes that she is somehow in annemaries apartment she is covered in blood and annemarie is screaming hysterically in another room a meat cleaver is lying next to helen and she picks it up terrified at what she may find going on in the other room she finds annemaries dog decapitated its blood everywhere annemarie is screaming over the empty crib of her son who is now missing when she sees helen approaching her with a cleaver she immediately thinks helen is responsible and she rushes at her attacking her when it seems as if annemarie may kill her helen strikes her with the cleaver wounding her shoulder just as police break though the door of the apartment and surround helenat the precinct helen is subjected to a strip search in a humiliating way by a rude policewoman rusty schwimmer who would not even get close to her only bluntly asking her to take off all her clothes later detective valento appears this time speaking furiously to helen it is clear that everybody thinks she is responsible for the attack and kidnapping of annemaries child she makes a phone call to trevor only to discover that trevor is somehow not home even though it is 3am the next day he comes for helen and takes her home helping her though a throng of reporters and news cameras her lawyer john rensenhouse tells helen that the prosecutors seem to have released her because they think the childs body will turn up and they will then charge helen with murder 1 which he thinks is unlikely to stick helen is somewhat comforted but she still cannot comprehend what has happened to her she questions trevor about where he was at 3am and he claims he was home sleepingthe next day helen looks more at the slides she took at cabrinigreen and in one shot she is able to see candyman standing behind her even though he was not there when she took the shot he then appears to her once again emerging from her medicine chest then seemingly everywhere at once she cannot escape him he talks to her again saying she belongs to him and that she will be immortal if she surrenders to him she is paralyzed with fear but she hears bernie knocking at the door to her apartment carrying a spray of flowers presumably to cheer helen helen tries to scream and warn her but bernie enters and is killed by candymanthis time helen awakens under much more dire circumstances trevor enters the room and she watches bloodied helen holding a knife asking him to help her she gets handcuffed to a gurney and being given injections she breaks free from her police guard and rushes into the other room to see bernies mutilated corpse as helen is taken away in a police car she hears candymans voice and she begs him not to hurt the baby helen is taken to an institution and strapped down and injected but when she is alone candyman appears to her again hovering in the air over her he tells her that her life is over and that she belongs to him now when she screams for help medics come in and of course they cannot see candyman only helenhelen is eventually taken to see dr burke stanley desantis who informs her that he is working for her defense helen is astonished to learn that she has been in the facility for an entire month under heavy sedations when they breach the subject of candyman helen calls for him by looking into a mirror and saying his name five times candyman appears and kills dr burke then slashes helens bonds he levitates through a window and disappears smashing the glass helen uses the window to escape edging her way to another room and knocking a nurse unconscious stealing her uniform and ultimately escaping the hospitalhelen goes home to her apartment and is in for an even greater shock trevor has moved his young student in and they are in the process of completely redecorating the apartment they are terrified to see helen as she has been accused of savage crimes she tells trevor he was all she had left in the world and then she leaves much to their relief with nowhere else to go helen goes to cabrinigreen and seeks out candymans lair she finds him asleep and tries to kill him with a hook but he awakens and tells her to surrender to him he promises helen that the pain of her death will be exquisite and that she neednt fear the afterlife as she will be immortal like he is he tries to kiss helen and bees swarm out of his mouth and his body stinging helen and she swoonshelen regains consciousness and finds that she is alone looking at the walls of the lair she realizes through paintings he has done on the walls that she herself is the image of candymans lost love the young woman that he lost his life over many years before wandering outside she hears the baby crying from somewhere nearby and realizes that anthony is inside the large pile of scrap wood and garbage that the resident of cabrinigreen intend to burn for a bonfire when she goes into the pile to rescue him jake awakens and sees her scrambling among the garbage with a hook in her hand mistaking her for candyman jake alerts a group of other residents and together they go outside with gasoline and torches to burn candyman alive on the bonfire as the flames spread helen reaches the baby inside the bonfire but candyman appears to restrain her from escaping he encourages helen to stay with him and be burned alive in order to fuel their own legend helen fights back impaling candyman with a burning shard of wood and she manages to crawl out of the fire while protecting baby anthony annemarie sees them and is overcome both by finding her child alive and realizing that helen has delivered him safely out of the burning wreckage badly burned by the fire helen diesat helens funeral trevor a few others are the only mourners until suddenly they look up and see a huge group of residents from cabrinigreen marching among the gravestones making their way to her gravesite annemarie and jake are at the forefront annemarie is carrying baby anthony triumphantly jake removes candymans hook from under his coat apparently pulled from the ashes of the fire he drops it into helens graveafter the funeral trevor and his new girlfriend stacey carolyn lowery are at their apartment the same apartment where helen used to live trevor has isolated himself in the bathroom shaking with grief while the young girl angrily waits in the kitchen seemingly annoyed that trevor is greiving the loss of his wife sobbing trevor looks in the mirror and mumbles helens name and over and over suddenly helen appears behind him a ghostly apparition holding a hook she uses the hook to murder trevor gutting his body and leaving it lying in the tub for his new girlfriend to find her own legend has just begun 6.5candyman mirror urban-legend hook investigation hook-for-a-hand mental-institution betrayal
