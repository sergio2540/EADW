scream in the apartment and the manager who opened the balcony door to check the place aces theory is proven rogers balcony door is made of soundproof glass and thus rogers neighbor couldnt have heard

until ace mentions the name ray finkle ace shares his theory with the lieutenant finkle has come back to take his revenge right at super bowl time when it will be most harmful to the dolphins snowflake was the first target of revenge because the dolphin had been given finkles old number and taught to kick a field goal as part of the halftime show ace also theorizes that podacter was murdered because he recognized finkle from his previous tenure with the dolphins lt einhorn actually applauds aces work making physical advancements towards the pet detective which ace rebuffsdesperate to find out more about ray finkle ace goes to the mental hospital where the explayer was held in an attempt to search through any remaining belongings melissa poses as an anguished
