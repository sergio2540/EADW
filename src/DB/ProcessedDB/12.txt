all agree to do a job together for a little revenge however little do they know that someone else has the strings and that they are all the puppetsall because each of them crossed the wrong person at

the story of keyser söze as he apparently heard it verbals flashback reveals sözes family being harassed by a rival hungarian gang in turkey söze goes on a murderous vendetta against all those who were involved afterwards he apparently disappears thereafter he rarely conducts business without an alias and maintains anonymity between himself and anyone working for him with time sözes story takes on mythic stature with most people either doubting his existence or disbelieving it entirelyback in the present kint continues to tell his version of what happened then his flashback resumes to reveal fensters attempt to run away but he is tracked and killed offcamera by kobayashi the remaining four thieves kidnap kobayashi believing söze to be a cover for his activities and intending to kill him if he does not leave them alone before mcmanus can execute him kobayashi reveals that lawyer edie finneran suzy amis keatons girlfriend is in his office kobayashi also says that he has the will the information and the means to injure or kill the remaining four criminals relatives if they do not go through with the arrangementon the night of the cocaine deal the sellersa group of argentine mobstersare on the dock as are the buyersa group of hungarian mobsters keaton tells verbal to stay back and to take the money to edie if the plan goes awry so she can pursue kobayashi her way verbal reluctantly agrees to do so he watches the boat from a distance in hiding as keaton mcmanus and hockney attack the men at the pier in a huge gunfightduring the battle hockney is killed as keaton and

lights a cigarette with a gold lighter he appears to speak briefly with keaton before apparently shooting him the scene which began the film in medias resin the present with verbals story finished kujan reveals what he has deduced with the aide of baer the boat hijacking was not about cocaine but rather to ensure that one man aboard the shipthe hispanic passenger held captive one of the few individuals alive who could positively identify sözeis killed after söze presumably killed the man he eliminated everyone else on the ship and set it ablaze kujan reveals that edie has also been killed kujan has concluded that keaton was keyser söze verbal admits that the whole affair from the beginning was keatons idea his bail having been posted verbal departs with his immunityverbal retrieves his personal effects from the property officer as kujan relaxing in the office he used for the interrogation notices that details and names from verbals story are words appearing on various objects around the room redfoot is the name on a wanted poster for example and kobayashi is written on the bottom of a coffee cup that verbal handled earlier quickly putting the pieces together kujan realizes that verbal made up practically the entire story he runs outside as a fax arrives with the police artists impression of keyser sözes face which resembles verbal kint as he leaves the police station verbals distinctive limp gradually disappears and he shakes out his palsied hand he steps into a waiting car driven by mr kobayashi departing just as kujan comes outside to see too late that kint is gone verbal kint is keyser söze so how much of his narration was truthful is open to interpretation 8.7criminal suspect revenge cargo ship explosion lawyer ship fire customs criminal
