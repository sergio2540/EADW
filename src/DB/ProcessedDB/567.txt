especially when she discovers that wes craven is writing another nightmare film soon she realizes that freddy has now entered the real world and the only way to defeat him is to become nancy thompson once again in 1984 horror director wes craven created a nightmare on elm street it was acclaimed as one of the scariest movies ever made and made unknowns like robert englund johnny depp and heather langenkamp huge stars ten years later heather is living happily with her husband chase and her son dylan but her life has now been turned upside down because she is being stalked by a person who sounds like nightmare villain freddy krueger chase has just been killed in a car accident after he accidentally fell asleep behind the wheel dylan refuses to sleep any more and new line cinema has just offered her a part in the ultimate nightmare but some other strange things have been happening including earthquakes and craven being tightlipped about the script the ultimate truth is that freddy krueger is actually an ancient demon breaking out into our world but in order to do that he must go through heather and he knows he can get out by harming those near her heather langencamp is trying to put her nerves back together after a stalker disrupted the lives of her her husband and her child dylan meanwhile an ominous force has chosen the personhood of freddy krueger as its ticket into the real world suddenly heathers husband turns up dead as does his crew working on a mechanical glove for a new elm street movie and dylan starts complaining about a man with knives for fingers that is warded off by his trex doll calls to robert englund and wes craven reveal something is definitely wrong after a visit to wes heather begins to realize the only way to save her son and stop this evil force from coming into the real world is to play the role of nancy thompson one last time in an attempt to trap this demonic force in the stories of elm street once and for all just as the first nightmare film opened with the creation of freddys infamous glove new nightmare opens with the creation of an updated more sinister and sleeker looking glove as the maker of the claws appears to chop off his own hand in preparation for attaching the claws to his own wrist the other people on the set wince and the director wes craven encourages the effects specialists to pump more blood soon he yells cut print that gretchen heather langenkamp her husband chase and their son dylan are wandering around the set of the new nightmare on elm street moviepresently the claw which was only a prop a minute ago comes to life and starts maiming and killing the special effects crew dylan is now gone and as the claw advances to attack chase heather screams waking up in her own bed in her own house with chase during an earthquake in los angeles after the earthquake dies down chase has a couple of scratches which are the very same as he had received in the dream this causes heather to wonder if they were sustained in the earthquake or during the dream heather reveals she has been receiving harassing phone calls from someone who sounds an awful lot like freddy but theyve stopped for the last couple weeks until nowheather is a guest on a morning talk show the very same day where they discuss the 10th anniversary of the nightmare films also as part of the talk show lineup robert englund as himself tears through a screen dressed up as freddy krueger to surprise heather heather is slightly disturbed by this producer bob shaye asks heather to visit his office at new line cinema and explains that wes craven is working on a script for the new and final nightmare film heather is asked to reprise her role as main character nancy but decides against it with her own recent nightmares disturbing phone calls and disgruntlement over her sons change in behavior bob explains that her husband chase porter is also working on the film and he is creating a scary new glove for freddy much to heathers dismaywhen she gets home her son has an episode during which he warns her in a voice not of his own never sleep again worried heather asks chase to come home however chase falls asleep at the wheel on the way and dies supposedly in a car crash when heather goes to identify the body it seems to her that there may have been more than meets the eye to the crash as was made apparent by the clawlike marks on his chest dylan now also grief stricken continues acting even more strangelyshe enlists wes cravens help for making sense of whats been happening craven explains that he does not know much more than she does he dreams a scene or two each night and wakes up and writes them down craven goes on to tell her that in the script hes been writing pure evil can be temporarily defeated if its essence is effectively captured in a work of art that is able to allow evil to express itself craven explains that the evil has taken the form of freddy krueger because it is a familiar one freddy sees her as the gatekeeper who holds freddy at bay since heathers character nancy defeated freddy in the first movie who in turn eliminated nancy in the third but still couldnt be released to freddy it is heather that gave the character of nancy her fortitude freddy is attacking her at her weakest points trying to break her down before confronting her prompting her to leave just as confused as when she arrivedafter a short sleep in dylans room heather wakes to discover dylan is gone she goes downstairs and finds dylan in another episode heather finally takes dylan to the hospital there a doctor asks if dylan said anything during his trance heather says no but the doctor later gets it out of her that dylan has been doing freddylike actions and singing freddys theme later julie dylans babysitter shows up at the hospital and tells heather she had a nightmare about him soon two nurses want to sedate dylan but julie had been instructed by heather to not let dylan fall asleep while she goes home to get rex julie ends up punching a nurse and threatening another with a needle cameo appearance by wes cravens daughter and locks the door meanwhile heather tried to leave but had been stopped by security guards to be questioned by the doctor the doctor suspects heather is insane and tries to get her to agree to foster care next dylan drifts to sleep freddy appears in the locked hospital room and brutally slays julieironically in the same fashion as tina gray in the first film the nurses unlock the doors and discover the murder in progress they run but heather is concerned where dylan went the doctor realizes heather is right heather soon remembers home previously she comforted dylan by telling him their home is right across the freeway from the hospital she discovers a giant freddy dangling dylan from above traffic she arrives home and finds dylan but freddy begins to manipulate the world around her causing her to become nancy and her house to become the house on elm street by forcing heather to accept the role he wants her to play freddy rises out from dylans bed and is fully in the real world heather runs inside and into dylans room only to find him gone and the toy dinosaur dylan believed was protecting him totally eviscerated by freddyheather takes sleeping pills to join in on a lucid dream final showdown with freddy to save an already captured dylan it occurs in a hot steamy and waterlogged dreamscape ruin apparently freddys home turf dylan finds heather only for them both to be attacked by freddy heather is knocked out dylan is left in a state of defenselessnessfreddy lures dylan into a trap and tries to attack him vigorously heather discovers the battle and fights off freddy but freddy makes his tongue extend and wrap around her face dylan gets out of the trap to save heather by taking a large kitchen knife that she brought in with her stabbing freddys tongue and making it go back to its previous size the two succeed in killing freddy by locking him in a lit furnace where upon catching on fire in a hansel and gretellike ending his true visage is shown amidst a fiery blast all the while dylan  heather flee
