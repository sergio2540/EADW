bucklin laura burnett gary rodriguez brian smrz robert bobby z zajonc huge advancements in scientific technology have enabled a mogul to create an island full of living dinosaurs john hammond has invited four individuals along with his two grandchildren to join him at jurassic park but will everything go to plan especially when one of the parks own workers attempts to steal the dinosaur embryos and has to shut down critical security systems in the process its now a race for survival with dangerous creatures roaming all over the island on isla nublar a new park has just been built with genetically engineered dinosaurs tragedy strikes when one of the workers is killed by a velociraptor the founder of the park john hammond richard attenborough requests paleontologist dr alan grant sam neil and his assistant dr ellie sattler laura dern to come to the park and ensure that it is safe also joining them are hammonds lawyer donald gennaro martin ferrero and chaos theorist dr ian malcolm jeff goldblum when they reach the island they are amazed to discover that hammond has created living dinosaurs however at the same time they all have their doubts later hammonds grandchildren lex and tim ariana richards and joseph mazzello join the group in a tour of the park sattler leaves the tour to take care of an ill triceratops soon the power in the park is shut down by computer systems geek dennis nedry wayne knight who wishes to steal embryos from the park to sell to a secret buyer in the process many dinosaurs escape their paddocks including the deadly tyrannosaurus rex who during a thunderstorm escapes his paddock  attacks the children and eats gennaro malcolm is injured  grant and the children are then lost in the park meanwhile hammond sattler and the rest of the operations team learn that nedry who in the meantime has been killed has locked up the computer system to cover his tracks they attempt to get power back in the park in order to escape the island after shutting down the system then restoring it the group realizes that velociraptors are also on the loose  are now on the hunt for the visitors scientists develop a means of bringing dinosaurs to life using dna taken from dino blood which has been preserved inside insects encased in amber whilst hammond is showing off his dinosaur theme park to a selected audience a lawyer gerrano mathematician malcolm dino expert grant paleobotanist sattler and his grandchildren tim  lex nedry computer expert disables the security system so that he can make his escape with some stolen embryos this enables all the dinosaurs to escape their enclosures on a remote island a wealthy entrepreneur secretly creates a theme park featuring living dinosaurs drawn from prehistoric dna before opening the attraction to the public he invites a top paleontologist a paleobotanist a mathematiciantheorist and his two eager grandchildren to experience the park  and help calm anxious investors however their park visit is anything but tranquil as the parks security system breaks down the prehistoric creatures break out and the excitement builds to surprising results the story begins on isla nublar a small island 120 miles off the coast of costa rica a large group of construction workers and animal handlers offload a large container the creature within unseen during the process the animal attempts to escape an act which leads to a mass panic and the death of one of the workersthe narrative jumps forward to an amber mine in the dominican republic where we learn that miners extracting amber are involved with a geneticengineering company called ingen we also learn that the death of the worker seen earlier has raised serious concerns about the safety of the island and that the owner of the island is now seeking top scientific experts in the field to help endorse the parkfrom here we jump to a paleontological excavation in montana where we are introduced to our main heroes dr alan grant and his assistant ellie sattler as they slowly uncover the fossilized remains of a velociraptor perhaps natures most lethal and cunning predator to date a beautiful specimen evolved to killthe dig is cut short by the sudden appearance of grant and sattlers main sponsor the elderly and eccentric billionaire john hammond he invites them over to endorse his latest project a remote island resort where he claims that their unique biological attractions are guaranteed to drive children out their mindsgrant and sattler are acompanied by two other charactersthe equally eccentric chaos theorist dr ian malcolm and the lawyer donald genarro who represents hammonds investors as they arrive by helicopter they are treated to a unique spectacle of living breathing dinosaurs creatures beyond your wildest imagination resurrected from the dead and roaming a special zoological environment built to sustain them just the sight of these mighty beasts a towering brachiosaurus accompanied by a herd of parasaurolophus is enough to leave the stunned visitors breathless save for gennaros offhand comment were gonna make a fortune off this placea fortunelater as they arrive at the islands central resort and control facility the visitors are given a brief tour of the process ingen has succeeded in cloning animals from simple strands of dna salvaged from mosquitoes fed on dinosaur blood and preserved for untold millions of years inside fossilized amber the group is shown the eggincubation room just in time to witness the birth of a baby velociraptor a sight that deeply disturbs grant he demands to see where the adults are housedand we are shown the special containment facility seen in the introduction a fortress of electrified fences and dense foliage all that separates the humans from the most dangerous creature on the island grant is witness to the daily feeding of the animals a cow is lowered into the pit only to be stripped clean within moments the visitors and the audience is spared the gruesome sight of the carnage by a thick covering of jungle foliagethe group prepares to experience the theme parks central attraction in which visitors embark on a safarilike tour of the park on special electrified ford explorers grant sattler malcolm and gennaro are accompanied by hammonds two grand children lex and her little brother tim as the group heads off hammond settles into the main control room where his two computer experts arnold and nedry manage the complex infrastructure of the parkthe tour is largely uneventful the tyrannosaurus rex and dilophosaurus two extremely dangerous carnivores refuse to reveal themselves to the eager tourists a sick triceratops is also encountered tended to by the park vetrinarians whom sattler leaves the group to help out with an approaching tropical storm forces the tour to be cut short as most of the staff leave by ship for the mainlandin the meantime we learn the true colours of nedry  he has been hired to steal dinosaur embryoes for ingens rival corporation biosyn in order to steal the embryoes he shuts down security systems throughout the park but this also causes the tours electric cars to break down and the electrified fences shut down thus releasing the dinosaurs from containmentin the films most thrilling sequence a trex escapes its enclosure and proceeds to wreck the tour vehicles gennaro is eaten malcolm is critically injured but grant manages to escape with the terrified children in the meantime a lost and confused nedry trying to hand over the stolen embryoes to his contact encounters a venomspitting dilophosaurus and justice is dealtsattler and the park warden muldoon arrive in a jeep at the site of the trex attack to find the injured malcolm and the remains of gennarro but everyone else has disappeared the trex returns to give chase to the jeep down the road in an exciting car chase of an action sequence but the humans eventually manage to escapegrant and the kids spend the night sheltering up a tree and wake up to find a brachiosaurus grazing nearby lex is initially frightened but grant reassures her and the audience that brachiosaurs are peaceful herbivores and that dinosaurs arent monsters theyre just animals once more we are given the oppurtunity to appreciate the beauty and majesty of these magnificent creatureswith malcolm injured and park systems still offline arnold is forced to take drastic action and reset the systeman act that has the unintended consequences of freeing the vicious velociraptors from their enclosure arnold muldoon and sattler attempt to restore power only to have arnold and muldoon outsmarted and killed by the cunning creatures only sattler manages to narrowly avoid getting killedafter witnessing a stampede of ostrichlike dinosaurs known as gallimimus grant and the kids make it back to the main resort complex only to find it abandoned grant leaves the kids in the main dining area and tries to search for other survivors in the meantime lex and tim are cornered by a pair of raptors inside the main kitchen in one of the most terrifying scenes in the entire film the raptors stalk through the dark kitchen searching for the kids eventually lex and tim manage to lure one of the raptors into the freezer and lock it in but the other raptor chases them out of the kitchenmeeting up in the control room grant sattler and the kids attempt to restore power and communications to the park but are trapped in by the same raptor in the nick of time the security systems and phone lines are brought back online nevertheless the raptors manage to break into the control room and gives chase to our heroes throughout the entire buildingeventually our heroes are cornered by the last two raptors inside the main atrium just as all hope is lost the trex come crashing in and attacks the raptors buying enough time for the small group of humans to escapeas the humans evacuate the island by helicopter the trex gives a final victory roar behind a falling banner proclaiming when dinosaurs ruled the earth the ending scene is quite powerful and epic and perfectly captures the spirit of the
