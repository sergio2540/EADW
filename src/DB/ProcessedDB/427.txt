fires of prejudice and injustice in 1932 alabama presenting her tale first as a sweetly lulling reminiscence of events from her childhood the narrator draws us near with stories of daring neighborhood exploits by she her brother jem and their friend dill peopled with a cast of eccentrics maycomb a tired and sleepy town finds itself the venue of the trial of tom robinson a young black man falsely accused of raping an ignorant white woman atticus finch scout and jems widowed father and a deeply principled man is appointed to defend tom for whom a guilty verdict from an allwhite jury is a foregone conclusion juxtaposed against the story of the trial is the childrens hit and run relationship with boo radley a shutin who the children and dills aunt rachel suspect of insanity and who no one has seen in recent history cigarbox treasures found in the knot hole of a tree near the ramshackle radley house temper the childrens judgment of boo you never know someone atticus tells scout until you step inside their skin and walk around a little but fear keeps them at a distance until one night in streetlight and shadows the children confront an evil born of ignorance and blind hatred and must somehow find their way home the place a small town in the south of the united states the time the early 20th century a black man is accused of raping a woman and an idealistic lawyer gets to defend him we start watching the reasons that make his defense far from easy and thats mostly because nobody in this town seems determined to believe in the guiltlessness of an accused negro the movie is based on a novel by harper lee who interestingly enough was the assistant to truman capote when he did the research for the book in cold bloodthe story is told through the eyes of sixyearold scout mary badham a feisty young girl who lives in a small alabama town with her older brother jem philip alford and their widower father atticus finch gregory peckthere has been an arrest of a black man tom robinson brock peters accused of raping a white woman named mayella ewell collin wilcox the town is up in arms and theres talk of lynching a nigger whos obviously guiltyat the preliminary hearing someone needs to be appointed to defend tom and atticus is selected the town gets ready for a quick and speedy trial as the trial gets nearer some of the men in town decide to take matters into their own hands by removing tom from jail and hanging himsheriff tate frank overton comes to atticus and tells him of the impending action atticus takes a chair a lamp and a book down to the jail to sit up all night to guard tom but the drunken mob comes anyway and they tell atticus to get out of the way and let them get on with itscott jem and their neighbours nephew dill john mosna are hiding in the shadows during this interaction between atticus and the mob scout comes out and says hey to mr cunningham a member of the mob scout says i said hey mr cunningham again and its her presence that defuses the situationat various times throughout the movie the children discuss the crazy man who lives down the block they think boo radley robert duvall comes out at night and gets little kids and animals but boo is to play an interesting part in the story lateranother interesting scene is when the finch housekeeper cal estelle evans sees a dog coming down the street and its acting very strangly she tells someone to go fetch mr finch and the sheriff they come and the sheriff has a rifle it seems the dog is rabid and someone needs to shoot it before it gets too close the sheriff hands the gun to atticus and says he would prefer if atticus took the shot the children dont understand because they have no idea about this side of their father the sheriff says their dad is the best shot in the county sure enough atticus takes down the dog in one shotanother interesting side story in the picture involves strange happenings with a tree on the block jem and scout begin to find unusual items left in a knot hole in the tree like a medal pocket watch penknife and small soap carvings of jem and scout they see mr radley fill the hole with cement one daythe trial begins and it doesnt look good one of the first witnesses is bob ewell the victims father bob testifies how he came home and saw tom going out the side door and found mayella all beat upthen mayella gets on the stand and testifies that she saw tom coming by and tells him to come up to the house to break up a chifforobe and shell give him a nickel she says that when she went inside to get the nickel tom came up behind her and grabbed her when she screamed he hit her about the right side of her head and face round about that time her daddy comes up to the house and tom runs out the side door atticus asks her again about how tom held her and hit her and is she sure she says over and over that she is sureatticus asks tom to catch something in his left hand tom says that he cant use his left arm ever since it was crushed in an accident when he was 12 years old atticus points out that if tom had been the one to strike mayella the bruises would be on the left side of her face not the rightnow atticus calls tom to the stand atticus asks tom to tell his version tom says he was walking by the house and miss mayella asked him to come in the yard and break up the chifforobe tom says she was always asking him in to do little chores after he did the chore he says that mayella asked him to come inside to fix a door tom freezes at this point but atticus gets him to go on tom begins to sweat he describes how mayella grabbed him put her arms around him and kissed him bob ewell turned up saw what was happening and hollered at mayella as tom took offdespite the obvious evidence presented by atticus the
