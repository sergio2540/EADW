elizabeth corbett lee delong pascale dinizani behi djanati atai mathilde guyant laure marsac one of the obsessive speculations in american history is whether thomas jefferson in the years before he became president had an affair with and fathered a child with his 15yearold slave sally hemings jefferson in paris follows jefferson to france as the us ambassador to the court of louis xvi following the death of his wife his friendships and flirtations with the french his relationship with his daughters and slaves from home especially sally against the backdrop of the beginning of the french revolution an understated chronicle of events with a brilliant cast american actor nick nolte portrays thomas jefferson during the five year period from 1784 to 1789 when jefferson served as a diplomat stationed in paris in 1875 thomas jefferson became the united states minister to france at the dawn of the french revolutionthe story begins decades later in the midwestern united states where a journalist has traveled considerable distance to interview jeffersons wayward son madison hemings james earl jones hemings reveals many details primarily that jefferson died bankrupt his mother sally and his uncle james were actually the half siblings of jeffersons late spouse marthaalthough not depicted in film jeffersons fatherinlaw john wales was a virginia slave trader attorney and statesman wales had bequeathed his estate and his slaves to jefferson upon his death in 1773 also not depicted martha and thomas jefferson had six children of which only two daughters survived to adulthoodjefferson arrives in paris with his eldest surviving daughter martha patsy jefferson gwyneth paltrow and enrolls her into the care of an academy for girls the academy is part of the catholic church and as a protestant jeffersons daughter patsy is regarded among other noncatholic girls to remain of her own beliefs and free willjeffersons presence in europe finds him representing the united states with an insolvent congress and significant debt to the french military for their support and alliance during the american revolution he is introduced in time to many dignitaries including the adversarial ambassador to britain anthony valentine and the monarchs of france king louis xvi michael lonsdale and queen marie antoinette charlotte de turckheim jefferson also appeals to dutch bankers and requests substantial loans to keep the american government viablethe costumes and pageantry of the french elite seem to be rather parody at times but the film supports the pivotal moments of the one individual who achieved most of americas success in world history this film would be superb viewing for high school and college students a challenge of maturity to look beyond the prissy male aristocrats and search for the more important political victories and failuresthe pageantry emphasizes stark contrast between the french elite and the common people most of the subjects of the french empire are starving and frustrated peasants the king and queen appear frequently at intervals but appear to remain alive in france during jeffersons tenure as a us ambassador the common people also appear often while the french revolution progressively gains momentumjames hemings seth gilliam is an educated slave and manservant he is assigned to work among scholar chefs in jeffersons kitchen and home his young french colleagues introduce him to distilled spirits which he rejects at first claiming to have no money but is offered anyhowas there are no slaves in france james approaches jefferson about being compensated and jefferson agrees james continues to indulge and soon has a reputation for spending all of his money united states laws prohibit the education of slaves but james proves already to be highly learned james follows his ears as his duties to and from the presence of jefferson and other statesmen increase his knowledge that he is not a slave in francepatsy becomes homesick and depressed like her father she pleas for jefferson to send for his younger daughter polly patsy vows to care for polly as would a sister and a mother polly estelle eonnet arrives in paris with jeffersons teenage slave and maidservant sally hemings thandy newtonnick nolte performs a superb portrayal of thomas jefferson as a vibrant statesman and a passionate human being he is attracted to and pursued by maria cosway greta scacchi the wife of nobleman richard cosway simon callow jeffersons flights of fancy with maria result in his sustaining injury broken wrist while horseback ridingdirector james ivory brings the audience intimately into jeffersons dreams nightmares and human nature jefferson is a widower battling with depression whos physical and emotional pain are dynamically illustrated in cinema sallys loyal servitude and tenderness build an undeniable love and affection between these two human beingstime and circumstance arise up toward confrontation among all the women in jeffersons complicated life as a motion picture jefferson in paris is a strong meaningful and amazing visual experiencemany viewers of this film may jump to the obvious conclusions of slavery polygamy and children born out of wedlock particularly the multiracial children of american slaves but thomas jefferson confronts everything from family to politics with courage and charismajeffersons stature is invincible when he is confronted with sallys pregnancy by her brother james he calls in the presence of his eldest daughter patsy to hold the holy bible while jefferson swears a solemn oath to eventually emancipate james and sally in due time after they return to virginiathe film ends with printed credits about jeffersons political future and his controversial relationship with sally hemingsthe remainder of this synopsis is not depicted in film but is important to considerjefferson returned to virginia in 1789 with his two daughters patsy and pollly and his two slaves sally and jamesimmediately upon his return president washington wrote to him asking him to accept a seat in his cabinet as secretary of state jefferson accepted the appointment serving from 1790  1793 jefferson ran for president in 1796 as the democraticrepublican presidential candidate jefferson lost to john adams but had enough electoral votes to become vice president 17971801a new revolution in 1800 thomas jefferson and arron burr were elected in a tied number of electoral votes in february of 1801 after thirtysix ballots the house elected jefferson president and burr vice president jefferson owed his election victory to the souths inflated number of electors which counted slaves under the threefifths compromise jefferson was sworn in by chief justice john marshall at the new capitol in washington dcunlike washington who arrived at his inauguration in a stagecoach drawn by six cream colored horses jefferson arrived alone on horseback without guard or escort he was dressed in plain attire and after dismounting retired his own horse to the nearby stableas president jefferson used his influence to bring ohio into the union in 1802 the first state under the northwest ordinance prohibiting slavery in congress jefferson had authored the ordinance of 1787 in congressional committee under the articles of confederation he was therefore instrumental in prohibiting slavery not only to new territories but in the new states to come beginning with ohioin 1803 jefferson authorized the louisiana purchase a major land acquisition from france that doubled the size of the united states his diplomatic and missionary duties to the united states of america while serving five years in europe created a catalyst that solidified the new worldpresident for two four year terms jefferson was a peaceful leader but as commander in chief he responded swiftly against the ottoman empire he refused to pay the high tributes demanded by the barbary states while they were seizing american merchant ships and enslaving the crews for high ransoms it was the first declared war the united states fought on foreign land and seas the united states marine corps conquest on the shores of tripoli were under the command of president thomas jeffersonjefferson rose up to many challenges for which he struggled financially both in government and in person standing nearly 6 foot 3 inches jefferson was a big tall and compelling man whos physical presence and academic genius made him a powerful and respected acquaintance friend and ally in the enlightened free worldbiographer james parton said thomas jefferson could calculate an eclipse survey an estate tie an artery plan an edifice try a cause break a horse dance a minuet and play the violin which he does repeatedly in this film actor nick noltes cinematic image sustains well in everything ever wrote about thomas jefferson the most incredible man of his timethomas jefferson epitomized revolutionary ideals the film jefferson in paris presents thomas jefferson as a very elegant yet simple man whos diplomacy and rhetoric prevailed masterfully above and beyond his character imperfectionsthomas jefferson was the most talented copywriter and calligrapher of his time maybe of all time considering his eloquently beautiful compositions he was the principal author of the declaration of independenceone of the most amazing visualizations of the film jefferson in paris is his use of an ingenious linkage of hinged wood armatures which accurately follows his writing on a second page with
