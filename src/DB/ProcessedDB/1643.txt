later harry reveals that they have mutually decided to move in together harry and kate both intend on taking up a jobthey move in together and there are funny scenes where they look through apartments at the realtors office and add up the numbers of the addresses and apartment numbers and reject places because they are not numerically calming they believe that there is a vast interconnected system out there and if they can just align themselves correctly with the messages they are being given from astral they will be safekate becomes pregnant morris and his wife express concern on their decision to have a baby  after an heated argument with his brother harry declares that he too has a right to have a family like him as harry walks away from them kate follows him harry and kate stand on the edge of the bridge in the golden light of sunset fearful of what will happen with their baby fearful of how they will survive afraid of the madness coming again knowing what that is what that will mean and they flap their arms like the birds cawing cawing cawing reaching out to one another to grasp hands worried quite evident in their eyes but also laughing laughing not because they are happy but laughing because all they have is the moment in order to avoid any complications to the babyso that it may not inherit their disorder kate decides to go off her antipsychotics for the safety of the baby harry in an act of solidarity goes off his as well and they sit over the toilet flushing them down the bright green pills whirling down the drain reminiscent of the image of the wheel of
