saxons turn to one of their own sir robin of locksley  also known as robin hood  who often recklessly fights on their behalf against norman authority in an effort to restore what is rightfully the saxons until richards return richard to who robin is loyal as such robin is viewed as an outlaw by prince john and sir guy robins refuge is sherwood forest where he recruits men to fight for what he believes is right generally matching robins happygolucky temperament that band of merry men includes will scarlet john little renamed little john because of his hulking physical size and friar tuck

prince john and sir guy hope to use what they see as the growing attraction between robin and marian to capture robin and sentence him to death robin and marian the latter she believes clandestinely work against prince john and sir guy until king richards return when they hope all will be right with england but the return of king richard if it does happen does not automatically restore him to the throne especially if prince john can crown himself king in richards absence robin of locksley has gone to a state dinner fresh from killing a kings deer when prince john tells him he is assuming power
