kasper gutman with his enormous girth and feigned civility her only hope of protection comes from sam who is suspected by the police of one or the other murder more murders are yet to come and it will

statue of a falcon the only one of its kind private eye sam spade and his partner miles archer are approached by miss wonderly to follow a man floyd thursby who allegedly ran off with her younger sister the two accept the assignment because the money is good but spade also implies that the woman looks like trouble though she projects wholesome innocencethat night detective tom polhaus informs spade that archer has been shot and killed while tailing thursby even later that night two officers visit spade at his apartment and inquire about spades whereabouts in the last few hours spade asks what the visit is really about the officers say that thursby was also killed and that spade is a suspect since thursby likely killed archer they have no evidence against spade at the moment but tell him that they will be conducting an investigation into the matterthe next day spade gets a visit from archers wife with whom he has been having an affair the widow asks spade if he killed miles so that they could be together spade dismisses her and tells her to leave and coldly orders his secretary effie to remove all of archers belongings from the office he then goes to a new address left in a note from his client whose name he learns is brigid oshaughnessy he also finds out that brigid never had a sister and thursby was her acquaintance who had betrayed herlater spade is visited by another man joel cairo who offers spade 5000 if the private eye can retrieve a figurine of a black bird that has recently arrived while spade has no idea what the man is talking about he plays along suddenly cairo pulls a gun on spade and declares his intention to search spades office but when he approaches spade to search his person spade disarms him and knocks him unconscious after cataloguing cairos belongings and questioning him in return spade returns cairos firearm and allows the man to search his office following this spade is again contacted by brigid oshaughnessy she offers her sympathies for the death of his partner spade senses a connection between oshaughnessy and cairo and casually mentions that cairo has contacted him oshaughnessy gets extremely nervous when she hears this she tells spade that she must meet with cairo and asks spade to arrange a meeting spade agreeswhen cairo and brigid oshaughnessy meet they make references that the reader and spade dont initially comprehend cairo says he is ready to pay for the black figurine brigid oshaughnessy however says she does not have it at the moment they also refer to a mysterious figure g the fat man in the film whom they seem to be scared of the two then continue to talk about some events that happened overseas eventually oshaughnessy insinuates that cairo is a homosexual and cairo insinuates that oshaughnessy simply uses her body to get what she wants and the two begin to fight at this point the police show up coincidentally to talk to spade spade greets them at the door but refuses to let them in the officers say they know spade was having an affair with archers wife just as they are about to leave they hear cairo screaming for help they force their way into spades apartment and spade invents a story that involves describing how cairo and oshaughnessy were just playacting the officers seem to accept if not believe spades story but they take cairo with them down to the station for some grilling spade sends brigid to stay with effie where she will be safethe next morning spade makes his way to the hotel where cairo is staying cairo shows up disheveled saying that he was held in police custody through the night meanwhile spade notices that hes being tailed by some kid named wilmer cook he confronts the gunsel1 and tells him that both he and his boss g will have to deal with him at some point he later receives a call from casper gutman who wishes to meet with him gutman a huge person weighing over 300 lbs says he will pay handsomely for the black bird spade implies that he can get the item though at this point this is a bluff but wants to know what it is firstgutman tells him that the figurine was a gift from the island of malta to the king of spain a few hundred years ago but was lost on ship in transit it was covered with fine jewels but acquired a layer of black enamel at some time to conceal its value estimated to be in the millions gutman learned of its whereabouts seventeen years ago and has been looking for it ever since he traced it to the home of a russian general then sent three of his agents cairo thursby and brigid oshaughnessy to get it the latter supposedly did retrieve the figurine but learned of its value and decided to keep it for themselves spade starts to get dizzy at this point gutman has drugged him and when he goes to leave wilmer trips him and knocks him out by kicking his templewhen spade awakens he returns to his office and tells the story of the maltese falcon to effie soon afterwards an injured man identified as captain jacobi of la paloma shows up at the office he drops a package on the floor and then dies of gunshot wounds spade opens the package and finds the figurine falcon sam is called away from the office to prevent losing the item spade stores the package at a bus station lost luggage counter and mails himself the collection tag he first goes to the dock where la paloma was anchored but learns that a fire had been started on board he then proceeds to the place rhea gutman said she was when she phoned earlier there he finds a druggedup seventeenyear old girl her stomach all scratched up by a pin in attempts to keep herself awake who just manages to give him some information about the whereabouts of brigid which turns out to be a false leadwhen he arrives back at his apartment he finds oshaughnessy in a shadowy doorway inside wilmer cairo and gutman are there waiting gutman hands spade 10000 in cash in exchange for the bird spade takes the money but in addition says that they need a fall guy to take the blame for the murders of at least thursby and jacobi if not archer as well reluctantly both cairo and gutman agree to make wilmer the fall guy gutman proceeds to tell spade the missing pieces of the story the night that thursby was killed he was first approached by wilmer and gutman the latter attempted to reason with him but thursby remained loyal to brigid oshaughnessy and refused to cooperate later things escalated then wilmer shot thursby also brigid oshaughnessy had seduced captain jacobi and hid the falcon with him later brigid oshaughnessy instructed jacobi to deliver the package to spade once gutman learned of this fact he attempted to remove spade from the situation with the spiked drink wilmer managed to shoot the captain but jacobi still got to spades office to deliver the figurine after finishing his story gutman warns spade to be very careful with brigid oshaughnessy as she is not to be trustedspade places a call to his secretary effie and asks her to go the office and pick up the figurine effie brings it to spades apartment and spade hands the package to gutman who at this time is overwhelmed with excitement he checks the figurine but quickly learns that it is a fake he realizes with dismay that the russian must have discovered the true value of the falcon and made a copy during this time wilmer manages to escape from spades apartment gutman quickly regains composure and decides to go back to europe to continue the search before he leaves gutman asks spade for the 10000 spade returns 9000 saying hes keeping the remainder for his time and expenses then cairo and gutman leave spades apartmentimmediately after cairo and gutman leave spade phones the police department and tells them the entire story wilmer killed jacobi and thursby he also tells them what hotel gutman is staying at and urges them to hurry since gutman and cairo are leaving town soon afterwards spade angrily asks brigid oshaughnessy why she killed miles archer at first brigid oshaughnessy acts horrified at this accusation but seeing that she cannot lie anymore she drops the act she wanted to get thursby out of the picture so that she could have the falcon for herself so she hired archer to scare him off when thursby didnt leave she killed archer and attempted to pin the crime on thursby when thursby was later killed himself she knew that gutman was in town and that she needed another protector so she came back to spadehowever she says that shes also in love with spade and would have come back to him anyhow spade coldly replies that the penalty for murder is most likely twenty years and hell wait for her until she gets out if they hang her spade says that hell always remember her he goes on to say that while he despised miles archer the man was his partner and that hes going to turn her in to the police for his murder as that was a line he could not cross in the industry of detective work brigid oshaughnessy begs him not to but he replies that he has no choice when the police get gutman gutman will finger sam and brigid as accomplices thus the only way spade can avoid getting charged is to say he played both sides against each other he tells brigid oshaughnessy that he has some feelings for her but that he simply cant trust her just before the police arrive brigid oshaughnessy asks spade if the falcon had been real and hed gotten the entire 10000 would it have made a difference spade replies that while she shouldnt be so sure that hes crooked more money would have been one more item on her sidewhen the police finally show up at spades apartment spade immediately turns over brigid oshaughnessy as archers killer they tell spade that the kid wilmer was waiting for gutman at the hotel and shot him when he arrived spade also hands over the 1000 bill and the falcon to the police as evidence 8.2partner murder detective maltese-falcon statuette statue police criminal private-detective private-eye liar
