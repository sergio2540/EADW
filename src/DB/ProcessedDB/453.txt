decide to go into a piece of scenery the spanish galleon although encouraged by katherines two dolphins to stay away they continue the search leaving the submarine only to be assaulted by a great white the dolphins having sensed trouble from the start and visibly beseeching katherine to stay in the sub respond to katherines waving hands they heroically rescue mike and katherine by allowing them to ride them back to the safety of their dolphin penthis information is at first disbelieved by park owner calvin bouchard louis gossett jr  but is quite exciting to his friend the hunter phillip fitzroyce simon maccorkindale katherine protests fitzroyces intent to kill the creature so capturing it is the decided course the baby great white is captured and nursed to partial health by katherine and liz calvin orders it exhibited as being the first great white in captivity but it dies within minutesmeanwhile kelly forces sean to join her on the bumper boats but at the underwater tunnel a girl is terrified when she sees a hideous corpse later revealed to be overman bob up to a window katherine reveals that the bites came from a shark with a mouth a yard across which is initially ridiculed by fitzroyce saying that would indicate a shark of some 35 ft in length which is too big for a normal great white that means that the sharks mother has also breached the gates of the park but she cant convince calvin of this fact until the shark herself shows up at the window of their underwater cafe the shark exacts her revenge first by causing a leak that nearly drowns everyone in the underwater tunnel then turns her attention to everyone on the beach she fails to capture the waterskiers but capsizes sean and kellys bumper boat and kelly gets a laceration from the sharks coarse skinfitzroyce leads the shark into the filtration pipes where the water from the ocean is brought into the lagoon hoping to trap her inside however he drifts right into her mouth after his lifeline rope snapped he prepares a grenade but he is crushed to death before he can use itunaware of this michael has gone down to repair the underwater tunnel so the technicians can restore air pressure and drain the water with katherine to watch his back he welds the repair piece but with no pressure in the pipe to restrain her the shark breaks free of the filtration pipe and attacks katherine again but as usual she is protected by her dolphins they return to the control room with calvin and the technicians but the shark smashes through the acrylic glass flooding the room as everyone tries to escape mike notices fitzroyces body still inside the sharks mouth clutching the grenade mike uses a pole to pull the grenades pin and it explodes blowing the shark to pieceskatherine and mike float up to the surface explaining that calvin managed to rescue the female technician though the shark attacked the male technician and dropped him katherine is terrified for her dolphins until they triumphantly show up in
