the wolf of wall street dicaprio plays belfort a long island penny stockbroker who served 36 months in prison for defrauding investors in a massive 1990s securities scam that involved widespread corruption on wall street and in the corporate banking world including shoe designer steve madden in the early 1990s jordan belfort teamed with his partner donny azoff and started brokerage firm stratfordoakmont their company quickly grows from a staff of 20 to a staff of more than 250 and their status in the trading community and wall street grows exponentially so much that companies file their initial public offerings through them as their status grows so do the amount of substances they abuse and so do their lies they draw attention like no other throwing lavish parties for their staff when they hit the jackpot on high trades that ultimately leads to belfort featured on the cover of forbes magazine being called the wolf of wall st with the fbi onto belforts trading schemes he devises new ways to cover his tracks and watch his fortune grow belfort ultimately comes up with a scheme to stash their cash in a european bank but with the fbi watching him like a hawk how long will belfort and azoff be able to maintain their elaborate wealth and luxurious lifestyles the movie opens with a tv advertisement for stratton oakmont inc it discusses the nature of wall street brokers describing them as bulls or lions a lion walks through one of the floors of the companywe next see a large group of brokers playing a game where they throw little people onto a board with a dollar sign for a bullseye jordan belfort leonardo dicaprio then introduces himself among those playing this game he tells us that he is the son of two accountants living in bayside queens ever since he started working on wall street jordan has enjoyed a life of endless drugs and countless hookers of his choosing he is seen blowing cocaine into a hookers butt and then later flying a helicopter while hopped up on quaaludes we also see him driving his ferrari and getting a blowjob from a woman revealed to be his insanely gorgeous wife naomi lapaglia margot robbie according to jordan he does enough drugs to sedate the majority of new yorks population the one drug he loves the most however is the one that can make man conquer the world and that is money he snorts a line of coke with a 100 bill crumples it up and then tosses it in a wastebasketwhen he was 22 years old jordan began working on wall street while married to a woman named teresa petrillo cristin milioti he starts working as a broker and he meets his smoothtalking easygoing boss mark hanna matthew mcconaughey along with another abrasive and foulmouthed coboss peter deblasio barry rothbart jordan is astonished at how everybody talks and works he has a drink with mark who is doing a rhythmic chant while pounding his chest mark orders enough martinis for them to pass the fuck out he asks jordan how many times he jerks off jordan says about three or four times a week mark says those are rookie numbers and that he does it at least twice a day he starts babbling to jordan about how nobody knows if the stocks will go up down sideways or whatever and that its all a fugazy marks primary reason for going into stocks was pretty much just for hookers and blow he gets jordan to join in the money chantjordan starts his first day with his brokers license on what happens to be october 19 1987  aka black monday the stocks around the world plummet and jordan loses his job at home teresa suggests they pawn her wedding ring as he looks through the jobs section in the paper he comes across one place in long island investor centerjordan shows up to investor center in a suit the place is merely a small establishment that hardly looks professional jordan is greeted by dwayne spike jonze the man who runs the place he assigns jordan to pitch a sale for a company called aerotyne and he will receive 50 of the commission dwayne also offers to blow him for free if it works jordan calls a potential investor about aerotyne he sells it to him as a huge company were treated to a pic that shows it looking no bigger than a tool shed but the way he pitches it draws everybodys attention everybody in the office stops what theyre doing to listen to jordan he succeeds in making the saleafter a few months jordan is making serious money he is approached in a diner by a chubby bespectacled man with fluorescent white teeth named donnie azoff jonah hill he asks jordan if the jaguar outside is his car to which jordan says yes donnie says he lives in the same building as jordan and mentions he works selling childrens furniture he asks jordan how much money he makes and jordan says he made 72000 the previous month not believing it donnie asks to see a pay stub for 72000 jordan pulls one out and donnie calls his boss to tell him hes quitting to go into stocksjordan and donnie have drinks at a bar we learn that donnie married his cousin because he didnt like the idea of anybody else trying to sleep with her outside donnie smokes some crack and offers some to jordan he takes one hit and gets pumped telling donnie they need to go runningthe two find a garage where they plan to set up a business jordan recruits some of his friends to join they include robbie feinberg brian sacca nicknamed pinhead alden kupferberg henry zebrowski nicknamed sea otter chester ming kenneth choi nicky koskoff pj byrne nicknamed rugrat and brad jon bernthal brad is especially well known for making sales in his old neighborhood jordan tells brad to sell him a pen that he pulls out of his pocket brad tells him to write something on a napkin jordan says he doesnt have a pen and brad sells it to him jordan also brings along several guys from investor center including a guy called toby welch ethan supleejordan and donnie set up what is basically a boiler room in the garage they find the guys are all set up at desks ready to make calls with a script that jordan wrote for them they start with blue chip stocks like disney and att jordan calls one investor to purchase stocks in kodak jordan anticipates the deal by making sexual gestures to everyone just as the investor signs on from there jordan creates stratton oakmont and forms it into a much larger business with even more brokers working for him he has groups of ambitious and hopeful brokers clamoring in his office showing off their resumes to his face as one strattonite makes a sale the whole floor celebrates with a marching band and a big group of hookers they even have one employee get her head shaved if jordan pays her 10000 grand for her to use on a boob jobover the next few years the business of stratton oakmont gets around from forbes magazine to the fbi specifically agent patrick denham kyle chandler forbes does a piece on jordan calling him a sleazy robin hood and dubbing him the wolf of wall street jordan is at first angry about it but teresa tells him theres no such thing as bad publicity they bring on jordans father whom everyone refers to as mad max rob reiner due to his constantly irritated attitude this is established when we see him watching an episode of the equalizer with his wife leah christine ebersole and getting pissed because somebody is calling him forcing him to miss the show once he picks up the phone he becomes straight polite then back to angry he oversees his sons accounts and berates him and his partners for spending 26000 for a dinner interrupting their chat about using the little people for their game as seen earlierjordan throws a party where he announces a plan to take the company into the fucking stratosphere he is about to explain to us the effects of quaaludes but donnie suddenly rises and slowly goes over to jordans table in slow motion to mumble steve madden steve madden as jordan notes was the big name in womens shoes jordan then sees naomi for the first time he runs down to introduce himself inviting her to join him on his jet ski donnies wife hildy mackenzie meehan sees this and tries to get jordan away from naomi by saying teresa needs his help donnie then goes downstairs and starts masturbating to naomi in front of the whole partyjordan takes naomi out to dinner one night when he takes her home she invites him to her apartment for some tea jordan is extremely tempted by her right before she steps out of her room nude the two have sex for 11 seconds before jordan tries to get it going again he continues his affair with naomi for a while before teresa catches jordan doing coke off her breasts in the back of a limo she pulls jordan out and starts smacking him she tearfully asks him if he loves naomi but he doesnt reply narrating again in voiceover jordan says he felt bad about hurting teresa and then filed for divorce three days laternaomi moves into jordans apartment she hires a decorator to redo the place to jordans liking and she also hires a gay butler named nicholas jon spinogatti jordan likes him until the night that naomi comes home to find that nicholas is holding a gay orgy in the apartment she goes crying to jordan and tells him that 20000 in cash is missing from their room jordan donnie chester and rugrat interrogate nicholas about what he knows about the missing money nicholas refuses to answer questions and openly tells them that he thinks them questioning him is just gay prejudice chester punches him hard in the nose and he and donnie hold nicholas by his legs over the balcony jordan calls the cops who arrest nicholas for stealing and kick his ass insteadjordan manages to recover the stolen cash through money laundering since he recognizes that these practices are illegal he hires an attorney manny riskin jov favreau to keep them clear all jordan cares is that hes making more money than he and anybody else can know what to do withjordan proposes to naomi with a yellow diamond ring she accepts he holds a bachelor party in las vegas where even the plane ride consists of a lot of hookers and a lot of cocaine the wedding is also a pretty big event naomi introduces jordan to her english aunt emma joanna lumley who is aware of jordans cocaine use he even buys naomi a yacht as a wedding gift its also named naomi18 months later jordan and naomi have a daughter skyler by this time the couple is constantly bickering over jordans antics he slept through the night calling the name venice we see she is a hooker who pulled a lit candle out of jordans ass during sex and poured the hot wax on his back as he kept screaming wolfie his safety word jordan says this fighting is part of their routine which ends with them getting intimate when they put the baby to sleep naomi says she is wearing short skirts from now on and wont be wearing panties this is seen through the teddy bear cam by their two bodyguards both named roccoat work it is the day of an ipo meeting with steve madden jordan

request jordans wedding video tape he learns from bo dietl as himself that denham has pictures of jordans inner circle he invites denham and his partner agent hughes ted griffin onto the yacht naomi he shows them the list of everybody in attendance to the wedding when jordan tells denham of an employee of his that he hired after needing money for his mothers triple bypass surgery denham

and choking jordan grabs a little vial of coke from a drawer and pours the whole thing into his nose this is juxtaposed with a popeye cartoon as olive oyl feeds the sailor man some spinach with the tune accompanying jordan and the coke he pulls the food out of donnies mouth and saves himjordan wakes up the next morning to find the police they arrest him when they show him his lamborghini with a bunch of dents and scratches despite jordan thinking he got the car home in one piece he is released after its determined they have no proof jordan was ever behind the wheel of the car manny and max

jordan runs to tell the captain to take them to switzerland despite naomis insistence that they go to england for the funeral the captain warns that there may be choppy waters ahead but jordan doesnt care indeed they do sail right into dangerous waters jordan orders donnie to run and get more quaaludes even as donnie objects he runs downstairs anyway and brings the drugs up just as a huge wave
