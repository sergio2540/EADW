retrieve the arrow arthurs journey leads him to a small hut wherein resides a sorcerer named merlin and his pet owl archimedes who can talk merlin explains to arthur that he was expecting him to appear after they have tea merlin decides to accompany arthur back to his home and after packing up everything in the hut into a small satchel the two set offarthur and merlin arrive at the castle of sir ector where arthur is immediately put to work in the kitchen merlin introduces himself to ector and displays his powers to the doubting knight after some persuasion ector allows merlin to stay putting him up in the northwest tower a crumbling edifice of the castlea few days later archimedes observes the arrival of sir pelinore who has brought news from london of a jousting tournament to ector and kaye according to the rules the winner of the tournament will become the new king of england ector eagerly begins to have kaye train and in his excitement promises arthur that if he keeps working hard at his duties he can become kayes squiremerlin hears of this news and decides to push arthur to see his true potential as merlin can move into the past and the future he knows who arthur will become while walking outside along the castles moat merlin explains that he can turn into a fish this idea excites arthur and merline turns them both into fish to explore the moat however a much larger fish soon gives chase to young arthur until they both manage to escapearthurs tardiness in helping kaye practice results in him washing dishes merlin finds him and after bewitching the dishes and washing utensils leads arthur into the forest where they both are turned into squirrels by the sorcerer as arthur leaps among the trees he comes across a girl squirrel who is soon madly infatuated with him merlin finds the whole scenario cute until he is soon found irresistible by another squirrel merlin then changes himself and arthur back to normal the girl squirrel who was infatuated with arthur skitters away heartbrokenarthur and merlin return to the castle where ector lectures merlin for making arthur shirk his duties arthur tries to defend merlin but his mouthing off ends causes ector to declare that arthur will not become kayes squire and that that honor will belong to another person of the castle who is named hobbesarthur is dejected at what has happened but merlin tries to get him to persevere and plans to educate arthur as he attempts to explain things archimedes interjects on merlins teaching methods as merlin is educating arthur on things that will not be proven for hundreds of years and could very well lead people to think of arthur as a raving lunatic in their current dark agesexasperated at this lecturing merlin turns teaching duties over to archimedes while he fiddles with a model plane archimedes scoffs at the toy plane while merlin attempts to prove that man will fly his efforts lead to the plane plummeting like a rock to the moat below even though the planes flight was a failure arthur tells of how hes often dreamed of soaring like a bird it is then that merlin uses his magic to fulfill this wish archimedes then takes it upon himself to teach arthur to fly but is soon impressed by how quickly he has picked up the technique their lessons are then interrupted when a hawk appears chasing arthur into the nearby woodsarthur soon finds himself in the thatched hut of a witch named madam mim who playfully shows arthur her magic powers which are moreso for evil purposes as arthur explains more about merlin and his magic mim decides to destroy the little bird however before she can do this merlin appears and mim proposes a wizards duelmerlin accepts and the two head off into the woods where they then shapeshift into a number of creatures all in an attempt to destroy the other it appears that mim has won until merlin turns himself into a germ causing the witch to become gravely ill with mim now safely detained merlin arthur and archimedes head back to the castleback at the castle a few days later as kaye and ector prepare to head off to london for the tournament they are informed that kayes squire hobbes has come down with a terrible cold needing a replacement quickly ector recruits arthur arthur then joyfully goes to tell merlin the news archimedes commends the boy but merlin is incensed that after all hes done to try and teach arthur he has chosen such a demeaning thing as being a squire to kaye arthur tries to reason with merlin but the sorcerer grows so upset that he rockets out of the room yelling blow me to bermuda archimedes explains that hes gone to an undiscovered island somewhere but doesnt know if the sorcerer will returnin london the tournament is under way and kaye is soon up for battle however arthur realizes that he left kayes sword back at the inn they are staying at kaye furiously yells for arthur to retrieve it immediately when arthur gets there he is saddened to find the inn locked as archimedes looks around he sees the sword in the stone with little effort arthur draws the sword from its resting place and rushes back to the tournamentkaye is at first angered that the sword isnt his until sir ector notices the inscription and word spreads that someone has pulled the sword from the stone when ector asks arthur how he got it he refuses to believe the boy could have pulled the sword out himselfarthur ector kaye and a crowd return to the stone and anvil where ector reinserts the sword wanting arthur to do it again kaye brushes the boy aside feeling that since its already been pulled anyone can do it however the sword has again become immovable this causes a stampede of others trying to pull it out before several people demand that arthur try again the rabble dies down and arthur tries againand succeeds where the others have failedas the legend decrees arthur is made king of england however he is unsure just what to do and cries out for merlins help merlin then
