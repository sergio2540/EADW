lasovich doug jones roger clown marian caparr√≥s thomas lundy napo rocco salata a disease carried by common cockroaches is killing manhattan children in an effort to stop the epidemic an entomologist susan tyler creates a mutant breed of insect that secretes a fluid to kill the roaches this mutant breed was engineered to die after one generation but three years later susan finds out that the species has survived and evolved into a large gruesome monster that can mimic human form a virulent new disease is killing the children of manhattan and has reached epidemic proportions peter mann in desperation asks the entomologist dr susan tyler if she can help by killing the disease carrier the common cockroach susan genetically engineers a new species of predatory insect to exterminate the cockroach and then die off this novel solution works and the children recover but nature isnt the laboratory and things dont exactly go according to plan three years later people start to disappear mutilated bodies are found and wild rumors of giant insects mimicking man start to emerge from the bag people living in the subway under manhattan peter and susan are called in to investigate for the past two years new york has been in the grip of an epidemic stricklers disease is threatening to wipe out an entire generation of the citys children efforts to find either a vaccine or a cure have failed but there is some hope in the recent discovery that the common cockroach is responsible for spreading the disease dr peter mann jeremy northam of the center for disease control enlists the aid of dr susan tyler mira sorvino a noted entomologist she develops a new species of insect she calls the judas breed genetically engineered to secrete an enzyme that poisons normal cockroaches and then dies off without reproducing within 180 days six months later at a press conference dr mann announces that the epidemic is officially over peter and susan are now married and hope to start a family soon susan still has some misgivings about manipulating the dna of the judas breed but peter assures her they did the right thingon a rainy night three years later in a rundown church in a lower eastside neighborhood a preacher pakkwong ho is attacked and flees to the roof of the building his assailant a tall thin man in a long overcoat follows the preacher jumps onto a painters scaffold rigged to the side of the building to escape the ropes break and he falls to his death in the alley below after a few moments his body is dragged roughly into a nearby storm drain a tenyearold autistic boy chuy alexander goodwin watches dispassionately from the apartment building across the alley where he lives with his father manny giancarlo giannini chuy imitates the clicking sounds the attacker made with a pair of spoons repeating funny funny shoes to himself he begins to bend a scrap of wire into a small figurenext morning peter arrives at the church police officers checking on the broken scaffold have discovered a large group of illegal immigrants locked up in the basement all infected with yellow fever the cdc will need to set up a quarantine and investigate as peter and his assistant josh josh brolin look through the seedy old church they come across a nasty surprise in a basement passageway several large clumps of feces fastened to the ceiling and hanging down from it like stalactites peter is concerned since there is a connection between the basement passageways and the subway tunnels josh collects a sample for analysis later he shows peter one of the bizarre components found in the sample buttonsregular buttonsfrom human clothingthat afternoon susan is working in her lab with her assistant remy alix koromzay they are approached by a couple of twelveyearold boys james costa and javon barnwell susan has a standing offer to pay the neighborhood kids for any unusual bugs they find and these two have brought her a number of specimensincluding a very unusual one taped up in a cornflakes box she offers them 10 for everything they accept it and leave remy leaves shortly after by the rear exit where her bike is parked she bumps into a tall thin man in an overcoat mumbles an apology and slips on pastsusan extracts the bug from the cornflakes box with a pair of forceps large and unique nevertheless it appears to be just a baby she reaches to examine it with her other handit bites her latching ferociously onto the web of skin between her thumb and index finger startled she pulls it off roughly jams it down onto a pin board and stabs a large pin into it to hold it there she is surveying the damage to her hand when she notices the bug is secreting a large amount of frothy liquidlike the judas breed she searches through her files on the creation of the judas breedshe finds a litmus test strip made from the secretionscompared side by side with a test strip from the new bug they are identicalshe hears glass breakingthe lamp that was shining on the baby bug has been knocked to the floor and the nearby window is open when she investigates she finds the bug is gone she gets down on the floor to search for it unaware shes being watchedby a tall thin intruder clinging effortlessly to the ceiling above her when she stands up there is a sudden gust of wind and a shadow movesand she is alonepeter is shaken and angry when he hears of the incident he asks susan to cut back on the hours she spends alone in her lab at night her concern however is the judas breed if its still alive and reproducing theres no telling what longterm impact it could have she convinces peter that they need to get to the bottom of thisnext day the boys take peter susan and remy into the subway to where they found the bug they direct them to a locked door marked private which they claim wasnt locked the day they went through it susan gives them a picture of an egg sack an ootheca and asks if theyve seen anything like it they haventbut want to know what shell pay if they find one remy hustles them away telling them their dealing days are over peter and susan pick the lock on the door and enter what looks like an abandoned locker room their search is interrupted by a manhattan transit authority officer leonard charles dutton who threatens to arrest them both peter convinces him he is there on official cdc business but leonard stubbornly insists that peter will need to come back with the proper permits before hell let him in to look around peter vows to do so and also vows he will request leonard to be assigned as their personal escort through the maintenance grid tunnels for being so obstructivesusan waits on the subway platform while peter and leonard argue leaning against one of the pillars tapping her foot she notices chuy nearby imitating her tapping with his spoons when she walks over to say hello and engage him in conversation he merely remarks laceup shoesblacknine west the style color and manufacturer of the shoes she is wearing he goes back to manny who operates a shoeshine stand there on the platform she watches interested as chuy continues to imitate the tapping sounds made by all the people walking by and naming the shoes each is wearing she sees some of his wire sculptures which are really quite good and asks about them he holds one up that looks like the specimen she had in her lab the night before mr funny shoes he says susan asks manny why chuy doesnt go to schoolmanny simply responds he doesnt have to hes specialthe two young boys have gone back into the subway tunnels to look for an ootheca transients camped on the landings in this deserted part of the subway warn them not to go any further long john they call after the boys overcoat slimdont go down there or hell getcha the boys ignore them they find what theyre looking for in a remote part of the tunnel an ootheca the size of a gym bag but they find overcoat slim there too keeping watch he catches first one then the otherkilling them quickly and mercilesslysusan goes to talk with an old professormentor dr gates f murray abraham she tells him whats happened and asks if he thinks its possible some of the judas breed bugs survivedhe tells her he thinks its likely but they were engineered to die she says plaintively in the lab they all died yes susan but you let them out of the lab  he replies she asks if he still thinks it was wrong to do what she did he tells her three years earlier he would have called it unforgivable but he adds kindly that now with two healthy grandchildren probably alive only because of her work it would be hypocritical for him to pass judgmentlate that night chuy is watching the deserted church from his bedroom windowhe sees the tall thin man go inside gathering up his spoons and his bent wire figures he crawls out the window and goes down the fire escape the door of the church is boarded up but hes small enough to fit through the gaps inside he hears mr funny shoes clicking away and imitates him with his spoons mr funny shoes answers and chuy responds happily then there are more clicksa second mr funny shoes is in the room chuy continues to talk to both of thembut as they move in closer his facial expression changes from delighted to uneasynext morning remy calls and tells susan to meet her at a sewage treatment plant a friend of hers who works there has found something strange peter reminds susan they have the subway thing that morning she tells peter shell have to meet him there after she checks on this lead at the plant remys friend produces a tray which holds the head thorax and one set of legs of a mansize insect remy takes pictures of the creature with her polaroid camera and susan asks her to deliver the body to dr gates for dissection susan takes the pictures and goes to meet peter at the subwaymanny discovers chuy is missing he remembers the boys fascination for the church across the alley he goes over there to look around and sees one of chuys wire figures just inside the doorway armed with a zippo lighter and an oldfashioned straight razor he breaks into the church through a cellar door to look for chuyleonard peter and josh are making their way down through the subway access tunnels and none of them are happy they encounter another cluster of feces attached to the ceiling take samples and keep on moving at last they find themselves on a high platform overlooking the old armory station leonard glances down and sees a bug crawling like the one which disappeared from susans lab startled and disgusted he stamps on it rendering it useless for identification and study peter is furious and steps up close to leonard and they both begin to argue loudly with each other the platform beneath them collapses and they plunge to the floor below there seems to be no way to climb back up so josh who wasnt on the platform when it fell is sent back to the upper level to bring helpsusan waiting on the subway platform for peters return has been studying the pictures that remy took she notices something and starts creasing them accordianfolding them to show certain parts sidebyside and she realizes that the claws on the front pair of legs resemble a mans face when fitted together she notices suddenly that its late and peter has not come to meet her she approaches the only other person on the platform a tall thin man in an overcoat to ask if he has the correct timeit raises its head and she sees its a fullgrown mansize judas adult she turns to run it unfurls its wings and flies after her catching her and carrying her into the tunneljosh is still trying to find his way to the surface he stumbles onto a nest of oothecas a nearby judas adult is roused and comes after himjosh is caught and killed as brutally as the two boyssusan wakes up alone in an apparent cache of judas victimsdead partially consumed rottingand tries to find her way out she falls through a manhole and is discovered there by manny still looking for chuy trying to find help for her manny stumbles onto leonard and peter together they rescue susan from the manhole but they are pursued by a judas adult they are able to make it inside an old subway car but the judas adult also gets partly through the door they force the door shut cutting the judas bug in halfstill alive the upper half falls into the car and scuttles under a bench leonard shoots it emptying a full clip from his gun into it he reloads and pulls it out from under the bench to examine it still alive it slashes at him with its lethal front legs seriously injuring him with deep lacerations that bleed profusely leonard empties the second clip into it finally killing it but the scent of the blood attracts other judas adultsthey swarm over the car buffeting and ripping at it susan borrows mannys razor and cuts into the dead adult extracting its scent glands and they smear the secretions over any cracks in the windows and other openings the judas adults withdraw from the car apparently fooled by the scentleonard tells the others that they are in a coney island special car that may still be operable it might be possible for them to escape if they can restore the power peter volunteers to go out and check the power line manny volunteers to go out and throw the track switch giving him a chance to search a little longer for chuy leonard and susan will start the car and pick up peter and manny at a point further down susan smears the remaining secretions from the two scent glands on them to increase their chances of survivalpeter is able to find and repair the circuitry manny finds the track switch and miraculously also finds chuy nearby chuy has been spared by the bugs because they apparently think hes one of them hes unafraid of themhe even believes they are his friendsright up until the point at which a judas adult descends from the ceiling and tears manny to piecessusan and leonard are worried about peter and mannyits been too long for them to be gone leonard is severely crippled because of the wounds on his legsso susan puts on the last of the scent from the dead adult and goes out to find them manny is gonenothing left but blood and his crucifixbut chuy is still there terrified after witnessing the death of his father susan picks up the crucifix throws the track switch and takes chuy with her to hunt for peterpeter has turned on the power and the lights come on in the subway car leonard starts it up but it only moves a few feet and lurches to a standstill peter returns to the car but leonard wont let him in leonards wounds have begun to bleed again and there is no more bug scent to mask the smell the judas adults are beginning to come backleonard is doomed and he knows it peter reluctantly leaves him to go look for susan leonard leaves the car and heads down the track to decoy the bugs away from the others they swarm over him and kill him but his death helps the others to escapethe reunion of peter susan and chuy is brief peter persuades susan to take chuy and escape without himhe wants to try and wipe out the colony while hes here if he fails susan will have to tell authorities whats happened and find another way to destroy them he helps them into a dumb waiterservice elevator and sends them up to the next level the breeding male crashes into the chamber at that moment and peter is forced to run through a tiny access tunnel into another large chamber he slams the door behind him and looks around to see that he is in the main nursery of the colony surrounded by thousands of oothecas the chamber is half flooded with water and there are gas pipes and valves all around he opens several venting gas into the chamber the door bursts open a couple of judas adults swarm in with a piece of scrap metal he strikes the metal grid to create a spark before they can reach him on the third blow a spark ignites the gas the chamber explodes in flame and peter plunges into the watersusan and chuy have gotten out of the elevator and theyre standing in a track tunnel when they are knocked down by the explosion before they can recover the breeding male who has climbed up the elevator shaft crashes into the tunnel at a point between them he ignores susan and turns to chuy intent on killing the boy susan slashes her palm with mannys crucifix and holds it up so the male can scent the blood the male turns and chases her instead she hears a train coming and runs directly toward itat the last minute she jigs sharply to the side and the train hits the male head on badly damaged he clings on to the train slipping partly underneath as parts of him touch the ground they are torn away by the velocity and at last completely torn and dismembered he dies susan collects chuy and they make their way up to the streetlater they huddle in blankets on a bench outside the subway entrance dr gates approaches susan and tells her the fire department found no trace of the colonynothing could have survived the fire how about one of us she asks hopelessly he touches her hand and goes back to talk to the firemen chuy watches as firefighters evacuate people from the subway a tall man in a blanket is climbing slowly up the stairs susan joins chuy at the top of the stairs and chuy comments with satisfaction in his voice mountain boots size ten the man looks up and it is peter he climbs up the last few steps to them opens his arms and embraces them both 5.9insect disease entomologist epidemic cockroach subway giant insect sewer nest sweat killing an animal mutation glow stick hit by a train
