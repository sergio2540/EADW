exchange for westleys freedom humperdinck has no intention of holding up his end of the bargain and turns westley over to his friend and lieutenant count rugen christopher guest as soon as buttercup is out of earshotcount rugen is a cruel and arrogant man whose history is tied to inigo montoyas twenty years before the count visited inigos father diego montoya a famously skilled swordsmith and commissioned a sword of the highest quality the job was challenging because count rugen who did not give his name has six fingers on his right hand when the count came to collect his new weapon which was the best diego montoya had ever made rugen would pay only a fraction of the agreedupon cost when montoya objected count rugen killed him inigo challenged his fathers killer to a duel but he was only 11 the count bested him easily left him with a scar on each cheek and rode off  without his new sword the griefstricken boy vowed to avenge his father and spent the next twenty years studying swordsmanship and searching for the sixfingered man he kept the swordcount rugen has made a long study of pain and has built the machine a suctioncupbased instrument of torture which he believes can inflict the most intense pain a human being can experience he keeps the machine in a secret chamber beneath the castle grounds called the pit of despair and it is here that westley is takenhumperdinck with buttercup in tow goes home to prepare for his wedding and for the invasion of guilder for which he plans to get popular support in florin by murdering buttercup on their wedding night and blaming guilder buttercup shortly realizes that her love for westley is so strong that she cant bring herself to marry humperdinck she asks to be released from her promise on the grounds that shell kill herself on her wedding night if forced to go through with it humperdinck pretends to give in he suggests that westley might no longer love buttercup but he promises to send his four fastest ships in pursuit of the fugitive carrying copies of a letter from buttercup asking westley to come back for her he asks that if westley doesnt come back she consider marrying him humperdinck as an alternative to suicide buttercup serenely confident that her westley will save her agreesin the days leading up the wedding prince humperdinck makes a great show of beefing up security around the castle he orders florins thieves forest cleared of potential troublemakers and the guard at the castle gate increased fezzik is hired into the brute squad assigned to purge the thieves forest and learns that count rugen  inigos longsought sixfingered man  is in the castle when he finds a very inebriated inigo in the thieves forest fezzik takes him home sobers him up and tells him that hes found the sixfingered man inigo and fezzik resolve to go after count rugen but realize they need someone whos good at planning  someone like the man in blackmeanwhile in the pit of despair count rugen has used the machine on a low setting to suck away a year of westleys life when buttercup realizes that prince humperdinck never sent those ships to search for westley she calls him a coward he takes out his anger by running down to the pit cranking the machine all the way up and torturing westley to death buttercup still has no idea that humperdinck has westley fezzik and inigo hear westleys dying scream and come looking for him near the pit they meet the albino mel smith who has brought a wheelbarrow to haul away westleys body fezzik knocks him out by mistake before he can tell them where westley is so inigo

by humperdinck and doesnt want to take the job he threatens to call the brute squad to run them off but gives in when fezzik points out that hes on the the brute squad max diagnoses westley as being mostly dead and using bellows to give him the breath to answer asks westley what in his life is worth coming back from the dead for westley answers true love max pretends to misunderstand but his wife valerie carol kane badgers him to help and mentions that max lost his confidence when prince humperdinck gave him the sack inigo says that westley is buttercups true love and if max can bring him back to life it will ruin humperdincks wedding delighted at the prospect of doing the prince a bad turn max accepts their money and whips up a large chocolatecoated miracle pill inigo and fezzik go off

fezzik produces one that max gave him because it fit so nicein the castle chapel the wedding is ready to begin outside a dark apparition fezzik wearing the holocaust cloak and standing in the wheelbarrow pushed with difficulty by inigo who is also dragging the nearlyimmobile westley approaches the gate i am the dread pirate roberts the apparition booms there will be no survivors the guards

to the honeymoon suite by the king willoughby gray and queen anne dyson her new inlaws buttercup thanks the king for his kindness and tells him shell be killing herself shortly the king whos rather deaf and probably gaga replies wont that be niceinigo takes off after rugen but quickly runs into a locked door and calls for fezzik fezzik drapes the rubberylegged westley over a suit of armor and goes off to help hes puzzled when he comes back a few minutes later and westley is gone meanwhile though inigo has chased the count through the castle brought to bay in a banquet hall rugen pulls a dagger from his boot and throws it at inigo hitting him in the stomach inigo seems on the verge of expiring and the count is able to wound him in both shoulders then inigo pulls himself together and returns to the fight reciting his challenge his voice and his attack strengthening with every repetition hello my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die stop saying that the unnerved count whines just before inigo closes in after inflicting wounds on rugens cheeks and shoulders that match the wounds rugen inflicted on him inigo allows the count to bargain and beg for his life then kills him with a thrust to the gutin the honeymoon suite buttercup takes up a dagger as she prepares to kill herself a voice behind her says theres a shortage of perfect breasts in this world it would be a pity to damage yours she turns to find westley reclining on the bed and throws herself into his arms after a moment of blissful reunion buttercup confesses that without meaning to
