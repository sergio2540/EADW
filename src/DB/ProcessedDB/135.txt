kim neil jane pearl penny pearl kevin scott john swindells burnell tucker 2001 is a story of evolution sometime in the distant past someone or something nudged evolution by placing a monolith on earth presumably elsewhere throughout the universe as well evolution then enabled humankind to reach the moons surface where yet another monolith is found one that signals the monolith placers that humankind has evolved that far now a race begins between computers hal and human bowman to reach the monolith placers the winner will achieve the next step in evolution whatever that may be this movie is concerned with intelligence as the division between animal and human then asks a question what is the next division technology is treated as irrelevant to the questliterally serving as mere vehicles for the human crew and as a shell for the immature hal entity story told as a montage of impressions music and impressive and careful attention to subliminal detail a very influential film and still a class act even after 25 years when a large black monolith is found beneath the surface of the moon the reaction immediately is that it was intentionally buried when the point of origin is confirmed as jupiter an expedition is sent in hopes of finding the source when dr david bowman discovers faults in the expeditionary spacecrafts communications system he discovers more than he ever wanted to know the monoliths have been watching us they gave humankind the evolutionary kick in the pants it needed to survive at the dawn of time in 1999 humankind discovered a second monolith on the moon now in the year 2001 the ss discovery and its crew captains dave bowman and frank poole and their onboard computer hal 9000 must discover what alien force is watching earth when the world is ruled by apes one particular group discovers a mysterious rectangular monolith near their home which imparts upon them the knowledge of tool use and enables them to evolve into people a similar monolith is discovered on the moon and it is determined to have come from an area near jupiter astronaut dave bowman along with four companions sets off for jupiter on a spaceship controlled by hal 9000 a revolutionary computer system that is every bit humankinds equaland perhaps its superior when hal endangers the crews lives for the sake of the mission bowman will have to first overcome the computer then travel to the birthplace of the monolith to richard strauss tone poem thus spake zarathustra the title sequence shows the sun rising behind the earth which is behind the moontitle the dawn of manin a sere african landscape a group of apelike hominids and some tapirs compete for the meagre green plants a leopard attacks an ape while one group of apes is drinking at a waterhole another group approaches the two groups scream at each other and one party is driven off at night the apes huddle in fear among the rocks in the morning a tall thin rectangular black monolith stands among the rocks the apes are excited but touch the object and calm down soundtrack györgy ligetis requieman ape daniel richter lifts a femur bone from a skeletal pile and realizes it makes a fine weapon soundtrack thus spake zarathustra again the ape realizes that it can destroy other bones with the club three turning points in evolution happen simultaneously protohumans learn to kill with weapons to hunt using weapons and eat meat and to walk upright clubcarrying apes approach the group that drove them away from their waterhole the clubcarriers bludgeon the other groups alpha male to death and chase off the rest the victorious alpha male throws his club and it spins into the airtma1 or the monolith on the moon theres no title card introducing this section of the filmthe spinning bone segues instantly to spaceships above earth a panam space shuttle approaches a large spinning space station its revolutions mirroring those of the apes spinning bone as a single passenger dozes in his seat a flight attendant with velcro shoes recovers his floating pen the shuttle pilots carefully match rotation and steer the shuttle into the stations central docking bay soundtrack johann strauss blue danube waltzdr heywood floyd william sylvester meets an old friend in the arrivals lounge they go through a voiceprint security check in which floyd identifies his destination the moon the men chat dr floyd has a connecting flight in one hour floyd calls home from a video payphone booth and talks to his young daughter vivian kubrick whose birthday is the next day hes sorry hell miss her party but asks her what sort of present she wants she asks for a bushbaby the cost of the call is 170in the hilton lounge floyd stops to chat with some russian scientists on their way back to earth when floyd mentions he is going to clavius the russians say no one has had contact with clavius for 10 days and there are rumors of an epidemic floyd says he cannot discuss the matter and goes on his waya smaller spaceship approaches the moon a flight attendant serves food trays that consist of many compartments of liquid nourishment labeled with pictures  carrots peas and so on floyd sips his meal talks briefly with one of the flight officers then contemplates the long list of instructions for the zerog toilet he watches the moon approach the craft lands in a domed landing pad then descends underground to the main complex once again to johann strauss stately viennese waltzfloyd is introduced to a group of people in a conference room he congratulates them on their discovery he tries to explain the need for secrecy and the epidemic cover story floyd has come to get more facts and write a report for the councila shuttle skims over the lunar landscape inside floyd and two scientists enjoy sandwiches and review the findings a magnetic object was found and excavated theyre not sure what it is only that it was deliberately buried four million years agoat the dig site a tall thin black rectangular monolith  identical to the one the apes encountered  is examined by six people in spacesuits soundtrack györgy ligetis requiem again as they pose for a photo the object emits a loud highpitched noise and the astronauts grab their heads in paintitle jupiter mission 18 months latera long narrow spacecraft moves through space its parabolic antennae pointing backwards in the crew compartment dr frank poole gary lockwood jogs around the artificial gravity wheel along the narrow corridor formed by the edge of the wheel he runs past work stations communications equipment and five large coffinlike life support chambers with glass covers two are unoccupied and three hold white sarcophagusshaped pods containing hibernating members of the crewfrank is joined by commander dave bowman keir dullea the two men have a meal and watch a bbc news video from earlier that day the news report is about them and their ship the discovery 80 million miles from earth the report mentions the three astronauts who are in hibernation to save air and food they will be needed at the destination for a survey the sixth member of the crew is the hal9000 computer which can talk and mimic the human brain the newscaster interviews dave and frank together and then speaks to hal douglas rain who states he is foolproof and incapable of errorfrank catches some uv rays on a tanning bed and watches a video birthday greeting from his parents hal also wishes frank a happy birthday frank and hal play chess  hal wins dave sketches and shows his artwork to hal the computer expresses some concern about the mission and secrecy hal then announces there is a problem with the ae35 unit and it will fail with 100 certainty within 72 hours dave and frank discuss the problem with mission control they need to go eva outside the ship  extravehicular activity to replace the unit dave goes out in a spherical eva pod to the parabolic dish antennae in the center of the long ship he leaves the pod and swaps out the black box from a service panellater the two astronauts scan the removed ae35 unit but cant find any defects hal suggests putting it back in service to let it fail mission control believes hal has made an error because their hal9000 unit a twin to the one aboard discovery finds no flaw in the ae35 hal says that similar problems in the past have always proved not to be his fault it can only be attributable to human error and denies any chance of computer error dave and frank go to a pod to have a private chat under the ruse of looking at a communications problemdave turns off all the pods communications switches and the two men share their worries about hal if the ae35 unit doesnt fail as predicted the astronauts decide to disable hals higher functions without disturbing the automatic ship control functions which dave says will be tricky to do dave also wonders how hal will react because no 9000 unit has ever been disconnected before hal can see the men through the pods window and reads their lipsthis time poole goes out in the eva pod as frank approaches the dish assembly the pod sneaks up behind him suddenly frank is spinning off into space fumbling for his air hose which is disconnected and the pod is drifting in the other direction as frank tumbles away his voluntary movements slow and stop dave goes to the pod bay as hal says he doesnt know what happened dave uses a pod to recover franks body while hes away a computer malfunction alert goes off and the life signs of the three hibernating astronauts flatline a display reads life functions terminated hal refuses to open the pod bay doors for dave explaining that he knows dave is planning to disconnect him because he was able to read frank and daves lips when they discussed it he says the mission is too important to allow humans to jeopardize it dave says hell return to the ship through the airlock hal replies that dave will find that difficult without his helmet  which indeed dave forgot in his hurry to go after frank hal ends the conversationdave releases franks body and maneuvers the pod to the emergency airlock hatch he uses the pods arms to open the door then lines up the pods hatch with the opening dave holds his breath and jumps over to the ship where hes tossed around by escaping air before hes able to close the hatch now in a helmet dave goes to the computer room and climbs into an access compartment hal pleads for himself as dave pulls crystals from the memory center hals voice gets lower and slower as he sings daisy bell daisy daisy give me your answer do im half crazy all for the love of you and fades out as he is completely shut down hals performance is a nod to a speech synthesis project at bell laboratories in which an ibm 704 was programmed to sing the same song suddenly a video screen comes on and plays a recording of dr floyd explaining the secret purpose of the mission this is a prerecorded briefing made prior to your departure and which for security reasons of the highest importance has been known on board during the mission only by your hal9000 computer now that you are in jupiters space and the entire crew is revived it can be told to you eighteen months ago the first evidence of intelligent life off the earth was discovered it was buried 40 feet below the lunar surface near the crater tycho except for a single very powerful radio emission aimed at jupiter the fourmillionyearold black monolith has remained completely inert its origin and purpose are still a total mysterytitle jupiter and beyond the infiniteclose to jupiter another black monolith floats among the many moons we hear györgy ligetis requiem once again bowman leaves the discovery in another eva pod as the monolith and moons align a psychedelic light show begins and the pod enters a wormhole to the music of ligetis atmosphères dave sees a series of oddlycolored landscapes as if he was flying over them the pod ends up somewhere in time and space in a bedroom with a luminous white floor and furniture in the style of louis xvi dave gets out now a trembling greyhaired man next door in a similarly styled bathroom dave looks at himself in a mirror back in the bedroom someone is sitting at a table eating its dave again now much older and dressed in a dark velour robe old dave has a drink of wine the glass falls to the floor and breaks another man lies sleeping on the bed it is a still older dave who stirs and raises an arm the black monolith appears in the center of the room dave is transformed into a fetus in a sac floating in space the large openeyed fetus  the star child  gazes at the nearby earth soundtrack thus spake zarathustra 8.3monolith computer moon evolution year 2001 ape spacecraft astronaut alien
