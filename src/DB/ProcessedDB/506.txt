switchblade up to his neck before discarding both knifes off a railing both jim and buzz get slight injuries during the knife fight not to be outdone buzz and his thugs challenge jim to a chickie run with buzz and jim racing stolen cars towards an abyss the one who first jumps out of the car loses and is deemed a chicken cowardthat evening the game is held with judy and several students in
