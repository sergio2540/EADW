which they call mercury now they ran a test to see if anyone can decipher the code by putting it in a puzzle magazine now simon lynch an autistic boy who has an affinity for puzzles sees it and deciphers it and calls the nsa concerned the men in charge call their boss kudrow and inform of what happened kudrow worried what might happen if this gets out orders that simon be terminated the man he sends kills his parents but is unable to find simon and leaves when the police arrive the police call the fbi to send someone to take a report of simon who is missing and the man they send art jeffries is not exactly in good standing with the fbi because of an incident that occurred recently and is also not exactly ok because of the incident art finds simon who was hiding and takes him to the hospital while there the assassin takes another try but art saves simon and they go on the run the united states government is about to launch its brand new super code impossible to break or so they thought until it was broken by a nine year old autistic boy now the bodies are piling up to keep it secret and the mercury is rising the film opens with a hostage situation in south dakota where fbi agent art jeffries who as the inside man protects a 15 year old kid named james while trying to talk a bank robber named edgar halstrom into surrendering however the fbi task force kills the robbers and james jeffries confronts his superior hartley who tells him hed report to washington an infuriated jeffries punches hartley for that and for james deatha cryptographic code called mercury was created by the national security agency and allegedly so complex that its creators believe no computer on earth can decipher it originally it was created during the reagan administration as a test to keep the united states highest priority secrets under wraps one day the nsa receives a message from a nineyearold autistic savant named simon lynch who calls a telephone number written in the code which was secretly published in a puzzle magazine by two of the creators dean crandell and leo pedranski to see if anyone could break it crandell and pedranskis division chief lt colonel nick kudrow sees the boys ability to decipher the code as a liability and rather than rectify the problem adequately instead plans to silence simon sending a hit man peter burrell and his partner shayes to murder the boy and his parents martin and jennyafter shooting martin and jenny burrell searches the house fails to find simon and leaves at the sound of approaching sirens martin was able to call 911 before dying jeffries who has been demoted following a diagnosis of delusional paranoia is sent to investigate what is initially thought to be a murdersuicide of simons parents while investigating the scene jeffries finds simon hiding in a cache of his bedroom closet and takes the boy under his wing jeffries begins to realize the difficulty of protecting let alone questioning simon because of his impaired social abilities as a result of his autism but the chicago pd agree to assign a protection detail to simon burrell tries to kill simon again at the hospital but jeffries stops him he is then forced to terminate an assassin named shayes on the chicago l train the situation is further complicated by the fact that nobody at the fbi believes simon is in any danger and jeffries is soon framed by the nsa as a kidnapper with only his best friend and fellow agent tommy jordan aware that he did not commit the crime since jordan had been in contact with jeffries when the incident began despite his initial doubts jordan allows jeffries to borrow his car but warns him that hell have to report it stolen the following morning to avoid being implicated in this situation jeffries takes simon to his house where his parents were murdered the previous morning simon again calls the telephone number written in the code and after realizing that simon is talking to crandell and pendranski arrangements are made for a meeting at the wrigley building the next morning he meets a woman named stacey siebring in a coffee shop and asks her to watch simon for him while he goes to meet crandelljeffries meets crandell and they talk as they walk on a busy sidewalk as crandell tells jeffries about the code and kudrow burrell shoots him from behind and escapes from jeffries following a chase after the shooting and getting burrells photo from a traffic camera jeffries goes back to the coffee shop but simon and stacey are gone he goes outside and spots them coming across the street stacey says she and simon have become friends and simon agrees jeffires and simon then abruptly leave stacey jeffries then meets with jordan who delivers the information about burrells background as a special forces agent while jordan is now fully convinced this conspiracy is real jeffries doesnt want to involve him in this any further than he should later in the middle of the night jeffries and simon go to staceys place asking for a place to stay stacey reluctantly agrees and tells jeffries that she was going on a business trip to des moines to make the rent the next morningmeanwhile pedranski turns to jeffries for help but shortly after he is murdered too by burrell however he has managed to leave a letter detailing kudrows crimes which his girlfriend nsa analyst emily lang takes to the fbi and jordan discreetly arranges for her to meet with jeffries to show them both the carbon paper used to type the letter which being covered in pedranskis fingerprints is crucial evidence in its own right after the meeting with emily jeffries tells stacey to call anybody for an emergency except the police who were called off at the last minute during the hospital incident and he gives her jordans number to contact if there was an emergency while jeffries introduces himself to kudrow at his birthday party and demands that kudrow leave simon alone jordan under jeffries suggestion arranges for simon to go into witness protection after the meeting jeffries contacts his friend and jordan explains how the witness protection meeting is going to happen though they are unaware that their conversation over the phone is being monitored by kudrow when jeffries returns and finds stacey and simon gone he learns from jordan that they are fine and will meet them there just as jordan is given an order to head to the fbi directors officekudrow tries to have fbi sac special agent in charge joe lomax help him stop jeffries by using his authority and the fact that jordan arranged the witness protection under false pretenses he plans to have the nsa take over the protection for the meeting spot after kudrow leaves jordan shows the evidence to lomax and despite his initial doubts jordan confirms that the fingerprint markings on it were pedranskis now fully validating the evidence against kudrow jeffries with jordan and a small fbi task forces help set a trap at the meeting spot stacey arrives at the meeting spot and gives simon to kudrow and burrell who are posing as us marshalsonce lomax who is in the buildings security room gives the green light jordan and the fbi
