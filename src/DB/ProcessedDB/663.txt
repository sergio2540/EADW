jerry jensen alexandria walsh a simpleminded gardener named chance has spent all his life in the washington dc house of an old man when the man dies chance is put out on the street with no knowledge of the world except what he has learned from television after a run in with a limousine he ends up a guest of a woman eve and her husband ben an influential but sickly businessman now called chauncey gardner chance becomes friend and confidante to ben and an unlikely political insider chance peter sellers is a middleaged gardener who lives in the townhouse of a wealthy man in washington dc chance seems very simpleminded and has lived in the house his whole life tending the garden with virtually no contact with the outside world his cultural and social education is derived entirely from what he watches on the television sets provided by the old man who raised him the only other person in his life is louise the maid who cooks his meals and looks upon him as nothing more than a child who has failed to grow up when his benefactor dies chance is visited by attorneys handling the estate chance tells them about himself how he lived his whole life inside the house after he was apparently abandoned as a baby and left in a basket outside the front door where the old man took him in and raised him the lawyers force him to leave his sheltered existence and discover the outside world for the first timechance wanders aimlessly through a wintry and busy washington in oldfashioned clothes a homburg hat suitcase umbrella and a television remote from his old home although finelytailored many years ago his clothes are of the style which has now come back into fashion during the period of the story and so he is presumed to be an expensively welldressed man of means by those whom he encountersthat same evening chance comes across a tv shop and sees his own image in one of the tvs captured by a camera in the shop window while watching himself in it he is struck by a car owned by ben rand melvyn douglas a wealthy businessman rands wife eve shirley maclaine whom is inside the limo invites chance to their home to recover from his injured leg after being offered alcohol for the first time in his life chance coughs over it while being asked his name which instead of chance the gardener which is what he said is interpreted to be chauncey gardinerduring dinner at the rands home chance describes the attorneys coming to his former house and shutting it down where he lived his whole life after the death of the old man judging by his appearance and overall demeanor ben rand automatically assumes that chauncey is an upper class welltodo highly educated business man although chance is really describing being kicked out of the home where he tended to the garden after the death of his legal guardian ben rand perceives it as attorneys shutting down chances business because of financial problems after the death of his longterm boss and mentor the old man ben even assumes it must have been caused by kid lawyers from the sec obviously attributing it to have occurred at a higher more sophisticated level than a taxirs problem as most persons would likely have assumed sympathizing with him ben rand takes chance under his wing chances personal style and seemingly conservative and insightful ways embody many qualities that ben admires his simplistic serioussounding utterances which mostly concern the garden are interpreted as allegorical statements of deep wisdom and knowledge regarding business matters and the current state of the economy in americaben rand is also the confidant and adviser of the us president jack warden whom he introduces to chauncey chances remarks about how the garden changes with the seasons are interpreted by the president as economic and political advice relating to his concerns about the midterm unpopularity that many administrations face while in office chance as chauncey gardiner quickly rises to national public prominence he becomes a media celebrity with an appearance on a television talk show and is soon on the alist of the most wanted in washington society public opinion polls start to reflect just how much his simple brand of wisdom resonates with the jaded american public at an upscale washington cocktail lounge two important older welldressed men are discussing chauncey one says to the other there is a rumor he holds degrees in medicine as well as law rand dying of aplastic anemia encourages his wife to become close to chance knowing eve is a fragile womanrands doctor richard a dysart makes a few inquiries of his own and even after aquiring chances fingerprints and a photo of him becomes suspicious about chance when there is no record of him anywhere from attending grade schools to colleges as well as no history of employment or a police record rands doctor figures out that chance truly is an actual simpleton gardener totally oblivious and unaware to the ways of the world however the fact that chance has given rand an apparent acceptance of his illness and peace of mind with his imminent death makes the doctor hesitant to say anything he also obviously sees that chance possesses no guile no intent to deceive or any interest which would adversely impact ben or eve or have any adverse effect upon eve or the estate following bens deathjust days before his death rand rewrites his will to include chauncey at his funeral the president gives a longwinded readout of various bon mots and quotes made by rand over the years which hardly impresses the pallbearers who are members of the board of rands companies they hold a whispered discussion over potential replacements for the president in the next term of office as rands coffin is about to be interred in the family masonic pyramidlike mausoleum they unanimously agree on chauncey gardinerin the final shot chance oblivious to all this wanders away from the funeral ceremony and through rands wintry estate ever the gardener he straightens out a pine sapling and then walks off across the surface of a small lake the audience now sees chance physically walking on water he pauses dips his umbrella into the water under his feet as if testing its depth turns and then continues to walk on the water as rands quote life is a state of mind is superimposed in the background 8.1gardener television washington-d.c. businessman
