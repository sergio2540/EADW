world far more frightening than ww2s germany italy or russia the kind of world that is actually functioning earth is united under militaristic organization called federation even in 4school students like johnny rico are thought about importance of serving to the federation on the surface atmosphere looks pretty relaxed johnny is dating beautiful carmen he has successful high school football

of the insectoids and jealousy for carmens new boyfriend johnny strives to become one of the best soldiers federation has ever seen but bugs prove to be smarter and more resilient than he originally

career sergeant zim clancy brown johnny shows himself to be an outstanding leader and is made squad leader he also meets a former high school classmate dizzy flores dina meyer who has requested

training and is working with his high school rival zander patrick muldoon her decision to make the fleet her career dashes johnnys dreams as well as the future of his romance with her following a training incident in which one of his squad members is killed johnny is demoted from squad leader and publicly flogged in accordance with military law as johnny is telling his parents via videophone that he is quitting the infantry the transmission is interrupted the bugs have directed an asteroid at earth destroying buenos aires killing his parents and most of the population of that city as a result of this sneak attack earth declares war on the bugs and johnny stays with the infantrythe federations forces mount a largescale invasion of klendathu which becomes an unmitigated disaster due to underestimation of their foes combat abilities bug plasma energy discharges from the surface by huge tanker bugs thought to be flamespewing battle tanks on the surface now turn out to be giant artillery pieces capable of surfacetospace barrages creating massive damage to the fleet in spacewith much of the fleet in space destroyed or badly damaged the mobile infantry on the surface now cut off from air support is overcome by swarms of thousands of bug warriors over 100000 troops are killed before a retreat can be performed and several of johnnys fellow recruits are killed johnny himself being severly woundedlater at the ticonderoga battle station where the remains of the fleet dock carmen looks up johnny ricos name on a computer screen it shows over 308000 casualties from the oneday battle johnnys squad is almost wiped out and carmen due to an error in the casualty list believes he is deadfederation scientists are baffled by the bugs use of military tactics and postulate that there must be a caste of brain bugs that serve as generals for the arachnidsafter a few days rest johnny dizzy and fellow squad member ace levy jake busey are reassigned to the roughnecks a special unit of mobile infantry which is led by johnnys old highschool teacher lieutenant jean rasczak michael ironside a veteran of the first bug war several years earlier who has been brought out of retirement to lead the group back on earth a new sky marshal revises the campaign using strikes on other planets in the klendathu system to learn more about the arachnids tactics after aerial napalm strikes against the planets lt rasczaks squad lands on planet p to mop up johnnys leadership and his skill in combat while destroying a tanker bug earn him a field promotion to corporal that night lt raszcak grants the unit rest and relaxation during which johnny and dizzy wind up in beda few days later the roughnecks are assigned to investigate an outpost on planet p they find the garrison killed and learn that the bugs have sucked out the brains of some of the dead they find the cowardly commanding officer general owen marshall bell still alive rambling about the existence of some kind of leader bug responsible for the massacre suddenly the outpost is ambushed by thousands of warrior bugs with some tanker bugs in support most of the squad is killed including general owen and lt rasczak johnny takes command and requests an evacuation ship which happens to be flown by carmen and zander dizzy is fatally stabbed by a warrior bug and dies in johnnys armsafter dizzys funeral aboard a starship johnny and carmen are joined by carl now a highranking colonel in military intelligence carl admits that the roughnecks had been used as bait to test a theory which enrages johnny but the theory has proven correct the existence of brain bugs that control much of the arachnid behaviour carl assigns the roughnecks to search for a brain bug carl gives johnny a promotion to lieutenant and command of the roughnecksas the roughnecks explore the surface of the planet the fleet in space is again fired upon by hundreds of planetary tanker bugs during the attack the warships rodger young on which carmen is stationed as the pilot is hit by arachnid plasma energy fire cutting the ship in two carmen and zander manage to evacuate in an escape pod that crashes deep inside a bug nest several meters underground johnny learns of carmens situation and tells the rest of the squad to keep scouring the surface while he ace and sugar watkins seth gilliam search for carmen in the tunnels carl who has telepathic powers is able to provide johnny some guidance through his mind eventually they discover carmen and zander just as zanders brain is sucked out by the brain bug leader carmen saves herself by injuring the bug with a knife that zander had handed to her earlier watkins injured sacrifices himself to wipe out the bug nest with a small nuclear warhead johnny ace and carmen arrive on the surface and learn that the brain bug has been caught by the mobile infantry led by former sergeant zim who has been demoted to private in order to take part in combat as everyone celebrates carl joins johnny and carmen on the surface explaining that they will be able to learn how the bugs think and can turn the tide of the warconcluding with another propaganda news reel it is shown that johnny ace and carmen continue their service in the military as heroes prime examples to incoming recruits with johnny as leader of the roughnecks and carmen as captain of her own ship as the war
