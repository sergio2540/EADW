isla nublar john hammond reveals to ian malcolm that there was another island site b on which dinosaurs were bred before being transported to isla nublar left alone since the disaster the dinosaurs have flourished and hammond is anxious that the world see them in their natural environment before they are exploited ian malcolm is recruited by john hammond to lead a research team to isla sorna an island 87 miles to the south of isla nublar the site of the original jurassic park here ingen bioengineering had constructed the secret site b where the dinosaurs were actually bred and then transported to the park hammonds nephew who has taken control of ingen leads his own team to the island to capture the dinos and bring them back to the us to become attractions at a dino park in san diego the dinos cause havoc and have a field day with the movable feast with the apparent public discovery of the site b production island full of dinosaurs john hammond assembles a team to visit and document the area before it is exploited by others included in the four man team are dr ian malcolm and his girlfriend dr sarah harding when the team reaches the island they soon discover the presence of another group of people this new group however are not there for biological data but instead have something more sinister in mind after a series of events both groups become stranded when all their communication equipment is lost it is then that the terror really begins as both groups scramble for their lives the film picks up four years after the disaster at jurassic park on a nearby island dinosaurs have secretly survived and been allowed to roam free but now there is a more ominous threata plan to capture and bring the dinosaurs to the mainland john hammond who has lost control of his ingen company sees a chance to redeem himself for his past mistakes and sends an expedition led by ian malcolm to reach the island before the mercenary team gets there the two groups confront each other in the face of extreme danger and must team up for their own survival in a race against time the movie opens with an incident on the island of isla sorna codenamed site b by the ingen company located in the vicinity of isla nublar where the film jurassic park took placea british couple has stopped along the coast to relax and their daughter has gone off on her own she soon encounters a group of compsognathus or compies that attack her much to the shock of her family when they find her after hearing her scream loudlythe film then cuts to ian malcolm who is called to the mansion of john hammond the former head of ingen malcolm meets hammonds grandchildren lex and tim there whom he encountered on isla nublar in the first film malcolm also meets hammonds nephew peter ludlow who has taken over ingen as its new chief executive officer both trade barbs over the aftermath of the incidents at jurassic park with malcolm chastising ludlow for covering up what really happened and ludlow claiming malcolm went public telling stories of which malcolm counters he told the truth but took no payment for what he revealedmalcolm then is allowed to visit hammond who is now bedridden malcolm is soon shocked when hammond tells him about site b isla nublar was the location for jurassic park but site b was where the animals were originally created and bred however in the aftermath of hurricane clarissa site b was evacuated and the animals let loose to roam free with them inhabiting an environment free of human interference this shocks malcolm as he had assumed that the dinosaurs should have died since they were bred with a lysine deficiency that needed to be supplied by medical means hammond explains he has no idea why they are still alive and shocks malcolm when he explains that a research team has been recruited to conduct studies on this subject and that brings him to malcolm who hammond wants to be the 4th member of the teamhammond then explains that after the incidents at jurassic park ingen has been on the verge of chapter 11 bankruptcy for some time with the board wanting to exploit the remaining dinosaurs on site b for profit purposes hammond was able to keep them from doing so until the incident with the british family after this control of ingen was taken away from hammond and he explains that his plans for the research team are seen as a possible deterrent for whatever his nephew peter has plannedmalcolm of course refuses hammonds offer and plans to make sure that the research team does not set foot on the island however he soon finds that his former girlfriend sarah harding julianne moore has already arrived with the additional members to meet her in 3 days malcolm then leaves planning to rescue sarah from site bmalcolms next stop is a garage owned by eddie carr richard schiff who has been prepping vehicles and equipment for the expedition malcolm also meets nick van owen vince vaughan who was planning to take video and photographic footage for hammonds expedition malcolm is soon after joined by his daughter kelly vanessa lee chester kelly wants to come along on the expedition but malcolm explains she cant go and the two have a small altercation before malcolm sends her on her way telling her not to listen to himmalcolm eddie and nick transport two mercedes suvs and a modified rv to costa rica and then head to site b however the ferryman refuses to weight anchor near the islands claiming that some people wandered too close to the island chain and were never heard from again through translation nick explains that the islands are known as los cinco muertes the five deathsonce on the island eddie malcolm and nick locate sarah using a homing beacon on her backpack they encounter her taking pictures of a herd of stegosaurus with sarah seeming to be perfectly fine shortly after meeting up with her smoke can be seen from the direction of the rv and the group finds that kelly has stowed away this surprise is shortlived as suddenly a fleet of ingen helicopters can be seen flying in vehicles and equipmentthe team is headed up by peter ludlow and led by roland tembo a biggame hunter who is leading the expedition to round up various dinosaurs for ingen after the capture assignment is completed roland heads off to try and kill a tyrannosaurus rex which he considers his fee for the assignment roland instead finds an infant tyrannosaur and has it chained with the hope that its cries will bring its parents backmeanwhile ludlow has arranged a satellite uplink to ingens boardroom where he is attempting to drum up a sales pitch for ingens latest plan to get itself out of chapter 11 take john hammonds dream of a jurassic park but build it in a more convenient place ludlow tells of his dream for jurassic park san diego when suddenly the encampment is attacked by the dinosaurs that were caged moments ago having been freed by nick van owen and the otherson his way back to the rv nick finds the infant tyrannosaur and noting that it seems injured talks sarah into taking it back to the rv to be mended once back at the rv kelly notes that the rex is making sounds that could attract other animals wanting to be somewhere safe malcolm has eddie take kelly into a special perched cage high up in the trees some ways off as they look out over the trees a familiar sound reaches malcolms ears and he then heads back to the rvsoon after the tyrannosaurs come for their infant and it is returned to them however they then proceed to push the rv off the nearby cliffside eddie heads to their rescue and manages to save malcolm sarah and nick but not before he is eaten by the rexesthe group soon meets up with ludlow and rolands groups and now have to work together to get off the island the only way to radio for communications now is at the main facility in the interior of the island ludlow warns them that it will be dangerous because of scans having shown that velociraptors are located in the island interiorthe group then sets out for the interior of the island one evening very close to their destination the trexes happen to find them as the female chases after one group roland attempts to kill the male however he soon finds that someone has removed the shells from his gun and he instead uses tranquilizers to take down the malein the confusion some men scatter into a field of tallgrass where they are taken down by velociraptors hiding in the field malcolm kelly sarah and nick end up making their way to the abandoned main facility while nick radios for a rescue team malcolm sarah and kelly end up trying to fend off a group of raptors that have chased them into the facility they manage to escape along with nick when a helicopter arrives at the facility as the helicopter takes off they see that a group has also come for roland peter ludlow and some of the remaining survivors the crew has also had a giant cage rigged to transport the tranquilized male trex to a waiting shipboth groups arrive in san diego california where malcolm and sarah quickly head to ingens waterfront facility where ludlow has arranged a lastminute press conference to herald the arrival of the male trex as the main attraction for the stillinconstruction jurassic park san diegohowever instead of going smoothly the ship the creature is on crashes into the docks ludlow malcolm sarah and some workers go aboard only to find dismembered pieces of the crew and the cage with the rex broken apart suddenly the doors to the cargo hold burst open and the male trex emerges making his way off the ship and into the city of san diegosarah and malcolm soon find a surviving crew member who explains that after they were in transport of the trex it stopped breathing so an additional drug was given however being unfamiliar with the trex proper dosage was not known because of this the animal is dehydrated sarah figures that the trex will first find water and then look for food they receive word that ludlow brought the infant tyrannosaur as well and transported it in his personal jet to the stillinconstruction park the two head there to retrieve it in hopes to use it to lure the trex back to the docksafter recovering the infant the two find the trex rampaging through the city upon hearing and smelling the infant the trex follows the malcolm and sarah back to the docks ludlow upon hearing what has happened orders that the adult male be shot and that the infant be recovered when he sees malcolm and sarah carrying the infant to the cargo ship he quickly follows only to find the infant in the cargo hold ludlow attempts to lure the infant out but soon after the adult male enters the hold and injures ludlow before allowing the infant to kill himsarah then launches a tranquilizer dart at the trex which subdues it as malcolm closes the holds doors in the aftermath the navy and a new crew escort the ship back to isla sorna as malcolm and sarah rest in front of the
