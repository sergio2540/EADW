thousand dollars and signs a deed laredo hands over five thousand promising to give the rest of the money later when quirt comes over to collectquirt is respectful of the quaker familys ways he hangs his holstered gun outside never allowing it inside exposure to the ways of the quakers starts to change not only gunfighter quirt but also the cynical atheistic doctor who attends to him grumbling all the timewhen quirt is able he helps the family in their farm work and is very grateful for their loving carefor penelope it has been virtually love at first sight quirt develops feelings for her as they chat about each other farm work and quaker beliefsin little time quirt kisses her and she reacts ecstaticallythey are interrupted by territorial marshal wistful mcclintock harry carey who questions quirt about his recent whereabouts penelopes statement that he hasnt been outside the farm for days is totally believed but the marshal warns about his habits and promises he will be watching closelyquirts romantic feelings cant help but increaseat one point penelope confesses her love for quirt and is surprised he doesnt feel the same i never thought it could happen to one and not another her outright innocence is incredibly touching and endearing and affects quirt deeplyquirt doesnt want to let the love take over because of the life that he leads and because he will be out looking for revenge on the people who shot him the tug of his old ways is still strongquirts reputation as a gunslinger comes in very handy in settling a dispute with a neighbor who has diverted water that used to flow toward the quaker settlement neighbor frederick carson paul hurst is convinced by quirt by the power of his menacing reputation to be a good neighbor and remove the top two boards holding back water that used to flow into flumes and irrigation ditchesnevertheless it is the genuine and uncritical welcome the old man subsequently receives from the worths that converts him from obnoxious neighbor into friend as carson is happily taking home a basket of pies and donuts from mrs worth he remarks to the as yet vacillating quirt about how good helping his neighbors makes him feelas quirt stays with the family longer their life becomes more attractive to himon the way to a surprise arranged for him at a quaker meeting quirt is seen by the passing randy mccall lee dixon who is an old friend and former partner in crime randy reverses course and goes alongat the meeting the quaker group thanks quirt publicly for solving the water problem and is given a bible randy is impressed then enthralled by the bible given to quirt and takes to reading it out loud at any opportunityduring the gathering the young and handsome local blacksmith approaches penelope and his interest in courting and marrying her is obvious quirt becomes jealous but isnt ready to take responsibilitiesrandy takes quirt aside after the ceremony and tells him that he knows that laredo is planning to rustle a large herd as it is driven through a nearby valley the next dayquirt overwhelmed by the quakers gratitude and convinced that he isnt good for penelope takes the opportunity to get away and try a return to his old life he takes the blacksmith aside and tells him to quit stalling and marry penelope and immediately departs with randythe laredo gangs attempt to rustle the herd is foiled by quirt and randy and another friend first there are galloping horses guns blazing falls from horses and a stampede as laredo attacks but then quirts gang comes from behind and one by one picks off the rustlers by using long wooden clubsnext we see randy and quirt drinking at a saloon and casino in red rock where lila joan barton is entertaining with her singing quirt is no longer the old quirt he gambles and wins a pile of chips that he gives to lila as a goodbye present in honor of their old relationship then he picks a fight with a group drinking at the bar by rudely pushing them aside and yelling more whiskey to start a massive saloon brawlhe makes it back to the worth farm and wants to resume with penelopemcclintock is not convinced of his desire to reform he remarks im patient thats what hangs all you fellas in the end im patient although his regard for quirts reputation is almost respectful you know quirt i always figured on usin a new rope in hangin you mcclintock keeps dropping by to see quirt and to interrogate him reminding quirt that he is going to enjoy hanging him and is waiting for a showdown with laredo so that he can  hang the winnerlater when he takes penelope on a buckboard wagon to pick blackberries quirt leaves his gun behind in deference to her wishes the scene where the two pick blackberries is a romantic idyll which ends abruptly when laredo and his gang spot them from a distance and menacingly approach in galloping horsesoutnumbered without a gun and with penelope at his side there is no option but to run and there follows a thrilling chase of a wagon on a road being pursued by men on horseback quirt maneuvers and takes jumps and steep and narrow paths one man collides with a tree branch but eventually his wagon runs off a ledge and falls from a great height into a deep narrow riverquirt manages to swim to hide below the rocks pulling an unconscious penelope with him laredo looks upon the scene from a height a few moments later and assumes quirt has drownedlater quirt walks into the worth farm carrying the unconscious penelope in his arms and the doctor is called the prognosis is bad the skeptical doctor takes up his sermonizing as to how dangerous quirt is to those around him and how frustrating his profession is that he works to patch up people who keep on doing dangerous things and being hurt again and againquirt who believes he is losing the great love of his life wants revenge and goes into town to face laredo when he is told laredo is in the saloonhe enters one end of town walking alone the townspeople scatter laredo is shocked to be told quirt is at the other end of town inviting him to come out first he sends one of his henchmen to peek out to verify then he decides to take another swig of a whisky bottle and waitsmeantime penelope has recovered consciousness and weak as she is demands to be driven to town in the wagon lying downthe worth wagon arrives on the scene penelope insists on trying to talk quirt out of violence quirt turns his back to the saloon to talk to her just as laredo emerges in part to protect penelope who would be in the line of fire quirt drops his gun and turns to face laredo weaponlessit might have been a sad finale were it not for the vigilant mcclintock who has his rifle pointed at laredo from a distance and shoots as he sees laredo reach for his gunso the bad guys die by causes that are natural to them namely bullets but quirt doesnt do the shootingas quirt departs on his way home with the worths the marshal picks up quirts gun and announces he will hang it in his office along with a new rope in memory of the adversary who never was 6.9quaker shot-in-the-back chase life-changing kiss miracle anti-hero bible sexy-dress colt-45
