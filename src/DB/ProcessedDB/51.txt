out to fight a war in europe suspicion and jealousy threatens to tear apart their once indestructible bond colonel wlliam ludlow and his three sons samuel tristan and alfred live in the rocky mountains of montana usa at the beginning of the 20th century when samuel brings with him his fiancé susanna the fellowship of the 3 brothers is about to be broken the eldest son alfred falls in love with susanna and she falls in love with tristan thing becomes worse when the three brothers decide to join the first world war in europe in 1914 despite their fathers objection the bond of the brothers is about to be broken forever and so is colonel williams heart this is a wonderful yet heartrending period piece as told by an elderly native american through a collection of family letters he accumulated and saved over timethe right and proper colonel william ludlow anthony hopkins a veteran of the native american wars that took place in the late 19th century has grown tired of the carnage and futility of war moreover he detests the governments and their greed that propagated the battles he has fought in the opening sequence the teepees have been struck the fires billowing white smoke as they symbolically die out along with the hope and freedom of the peopleat first glance the viewer might believe he is observing the remnants of the colonels last battle then a child is seen by his side and the mood changes as the realization that the look in his eyes is not one of the victor but that of sadness as he has come to know and respect the people and forcing them from their home has brought him to his breaking point he tosses his saber and sheath into the ground in disgust viewing his humbled former enemy and turns his back to the camera and on his former life the scene is similar to bury my heart at wounded knee in that the native americans those who survived are seen defeated and disheartened abandoning what was once their home the look on the victorious colonels face as he views his one time enemies says it allhopkins takes his wife cristina pickles three sons brad pitt aidan quinn and henry thomas and trusted cree guide one stab excellent perfomance by gordon tootoosis who also narrates and his family on a quest to lose the madness over the mountains and begin again although filmed almost entirely in british columbia the setting for the film is the mountains near helena montana the scenery alone is reason enough to let yourself become lost in this film temporarily lost from the madnessthe story unfolds as the boys are still in their teens and the youngest of the three samuel thomas is constantly watched over like a treasure by alfred quinn the oldest even old for his years and the colonels favorite the wild and fearless tristan pitt their mother has decided to leave the ranch citing the winters as too cruel as well as being afraid of the bears she was always a strange woman anyway tootoosis growls in that keenly authentic accent then goes on to say that alfred writes her often but tristan will not speak of her this sets the tone for how even the strongest of family ties can be as fragile as glass the colonel is then seen writing one of the many letters one stab has in his possession dated april 1913 a year before the beginning of the great war wwicorresponding with her husband mrs ludlow tells the colonel their youngest son will be returning from harvard the following summer and he will be accompanied by his new fiancée the dazzling julia ormond as susannah fincannon from the moment she and samuel step from the train the reaction to her beauty and grace by both the colonel and alfred the viewer begins to sense discord on the horizon alfred is clearly taken by her but the attention shifts quickly away to the absence of tristan after introductions samuel asks where his brother is and alfred scoffs ah hes off somewhere you know him hopkins colonel ludlow chimes in with authority well hell be here tonight to welcome his brother home or ill know the reason whythe following scenes find the brothers reacquainting themselves with one another and it is clear the two older brothers are more than impressed with young samuels betrothed observing this hopkins as only he can delivers one of the few humorous lines in the film embarrassing alfred by catching him offguard standing out of sight he admonishes him from the porch of the ranch alfred stop mooning over miss fincannon and get in hereas the group seem to be settling in for what one thinks will be a love story set entirely at the ranch shortly after a scene in which samuel sings with a certain boyish quality perhaps a hint of naiveté lingering in his voice news of the british troops being cut off in belgium arrives samuel is quick to point out to his father that with his fluent german he could become an officer samuel goes on to say that theyre out here in the middle of nowhere while all this is going on hopkins colonel ludlow becoming annoyed at the topic of war being discussed under his roof replies and thank god for thatto prove to his father his brothers his soon to be bride and perhaps more than anyone himself that he no longer needs protecting and is indeed a man samuel announces hes going to canada to enlist alfred immediately proclaims he will accompany his brother the camera briefly focuses on pitt and the look on his face is one of quiet resignation his future has just changed and hes not exactly pleasedlater the same evening susannah is being comforted by tristan holding her as she cries over the prospect of her beloved samuel unnecessarily going off to war as tristan is whispering in her ear that hell protect his younger brother alfred happens upon the scene and gets the impression the embrace between the two was more than just for comfort thus begins the tear in the bond of brotherhood once so strong nothing could come between themwhat follows is at times predicable but the rest makes up for the few parts the viewer can see coming and then some the story is an epic tale of right and wrong family love and how life can be at once beautiful and unrelentingly cruel especially where matters of the heart are concerned this is an unjustly overlooked piece of celluloid worthy of many more accolades it originally received frankly while some may argue kalifornia or thelma and louise had already accomplished this i think legends established pitt as a more talented and serious actor than his previous workthe performances how can anyone go wrong with such brilliant casting the score cinematography oscar winning are all first rate and the story will take you from wherever you are to a time when the pace of life was slower and things were easier or were they 7.5usa epic heart passion restlessness
