victoria charters jack janda peter kent david r maier karen mccanns eldest daughter is raped and murdered whilst on the phone with her when the case against robert doob the perpetrator is dismissed because of a technicality she starts following him and sees how he checks out his next victim a woman he delivers groceries to she tells the police but is only warned she must stop following doob when she tries to warn the woman she is shooed out of the house doob having found out that karen is following him threatens to do something to her youngest daughter she then seeks help from a group of vigilantes connected to a support group in order to shoot doob however a friend from the support group turns out to be an fbi agent investigating the very vigilante activity karen is involved in and warns her that she will go to jail for the rest of her life unless it is selfdefense in the meantime tension grows between karen and her husband mack because he finds out she has secretly been taking selfdefense classes and has been learning how to use a gun when doob makes another victim and is again released for lack of evidence she finds a way to lure him into her house and kill him in selfdefense after her daughter julie is brutally raped and murdered karen mccann is turned down by the lapd after she requests they keep suspect robert doob in jail for good instead of paroling him nevertheless the lapd and the courts do decide to parole him and karen turns to a group of hit man trainers for help they teach her how to manage a gun etc eventually karens husband mack finds out and tries to stop her karen backs off robert doob tracks karen down at the mccaan home and breaks in hoping to kill her karen mccann lives in santa monica california and her husband mack mccann is the owner of the mccann construction company karen works in a museum and she has two daughters they are 5yearold megan and 17yearold julie mack is megans biological father and julie was born from karens previous marriage mack still loves julie like shes his own daughter karen is on her way home from work one day when she calls home on her cell phone and julie answers julie is preparing for megans 6th birthday at the time of the call and karen is still talking to juliewhen a man suddenly breaks into the house and rapes and kills julie karen rushes home as fast as she can and is devastated by what she sees detective sergeant joe denillo is put on the case days later joe calls karen and tells karen that julies killer is robert doob a supermarket deliveryman who has been in and out of jail for most of his life in court karen is understandably enraged when robert is released on a technicality and mack is restrained when he lunges at robert robert later starts harassing megan and when karen starts checking out the neighborhood robert lives in robert threatens to go after megan unless karen stays away from roberts neighborhood when karen joins a support group for parents of violence victims she discovers that within this support group there is a secret society of parents led by bereaved parent sidney hughes who kill killers that the extremely flawed system has failed to adequately deal with karen joins this group and is soon undergoing training at a local firing range after robert rapes and kills a woman named maria robert is once again arrested but he is again released on a technicality this is when karen sends mack and megan to visit some relatives and forms a plan to do what the courts cant dostop robert once and for all in matters like these the system has a habit of giving people like karen absolutely no choice but to solve these kinds of problems themselves distraught over her oldest daughters rape and brutal murder and the fact that the murderer was turned loose on a technicality karen mccann seeks vengeance she learns selfdefense and becomes an expert marksman with a pistol and sets out to seek and destroy robert doob is the cocky killer and she must stop him before he can kill again after the assault rape and murder of her 17yearold daughter at home karen becomes obsessed with putting the rapist behind bars what karen soon finds is that the criminal justice system is more interested in procedure than justice and soon frees the killer of her daughter on a vague technicality karen finds that she has no options but to proceed with her own plans for justice as the system has again failed to protect the innocent and the victims karen mccannsally fieldis a woman with everything to live for she is happily married to macked harrisand
