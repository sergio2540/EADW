columbian cartel yayo portillo jacob vargas to buy a shipment of drugs catlett takes the drugs and gives portillo the key to an airport locker where the 500000 in cash is stowed portillo suspecting a set up and that the locker is being watched by the federal agents does not go to the locker but shows up at catletts mountainside house catlett shoots him and his body falls over the balcony down the mountainside catlett sends his bodyguard bear james gandolfini a sometimes stunt man to retrieve the key and hide the bodyzimm tells palmer about a movie he wants to produce mr lovejoy which has what he thinks is an oscar winning script he cant produce it however because catlett has already lent zimm 150000 to do a film called circus freaks zimm cant return the money because he lost it at vegas in

to it he is grabbed by federal agents but then released when they realize that they have made a mistake afterward bear confronts palmer in the parking lot to get the key back but is outmatched by palmer who levels him with a few blows as bear recovers palmer asks him about his stunt work and flatters him by knowing about the movies hes been in palmer mentions that he thinks bear can do a lot better than working for catlettthe key to making mr lovejoy a success is to get star martin weir danny devito to sign on flores is weirs exwife and still has a good relationship with him flores starts to become romantically involved with palmer and helps him get access to weir as it turns out weirs current girlfriend is rock star nicki renee props an old friend of palmers from miami soon palmer who

developingpalmer tracks down devoe and takes 310000 of the 500000 leaving him with just his vegas winnings devoe complains but palmer tells him if bones had found him instead bones would have taken all the money and killed himmeanwhile bones has learned of the money devoe has scammed from the airline he comes to la when zimm foolishly contacts him and tries to get him to invest in his film a meeting between the two doesnt go well and leaves zimm in a cast and head brace at the same meeting wingate appears and is shot by bones who then makes it look like zimm killed wingate in self defensethe fact that yayo has disappeared along with 500000 has brought colombia drug lord mr escobar miguel sandoval to la with two goons though catlett denies knowing what happened to yayo or the money it is clear that escobar holds catlett responsible giving him just a couple of days to find both of them or there will be fatal consequences desperate catlett confronts palmer to get devoes money kidnapping flores and taking her to his house until the cash is deliveredpalmer arrives at the house to rescue flores catlett plans to take the money and kill them both but with bears help bear

demands devoes money finding the airport locker key in palmers coat bones assumes that palmer has hid the money at the airport when bones goes to the airport and opens the locker we see the federal agents close around himthe scene suddenly switches to an airport set at a movie studio a voice addresses bones and when he turns around we see that the character is now portrayed by harvey keitel
