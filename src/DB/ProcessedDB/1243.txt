dees thinks the story is a waste of his time and suggests that editor
merton morrison dan monahan give the assignment to cub reporter katherine blair julie entwistle whom
dees has unaffectionately nicknamed jimmy after jimmy olson of superman
fame the next morning after katherine has been able to tap into a network
of local law enforcement agencies on her computer and find three cases
that all meet the batty fliers mo morrison again asks dees to take the
assignment this time dees agrees needless to say katherine isnt
pleased dees has his own airplane and decides to run the killers back
trailfirst stop is the cumberland county airport in falmouth maine where
claire bowie was killed dees gets the details from
ezra hannon john bennes on how as
he was turning over the night shift to claire the nightflying skymaster
landed out of the airplane walked a man wearing a long black cloak the
next morning hannon found claire washing down the skymaster the morning
after that claire was found with his throat ripped open the only strange
thing that hannon can recall was under the luggage baya big pile of dirt
filled with worms and maggots that night dees pays a visit to claires
grave in order to get a photograph later after drinking 34ths of a
bottle of booze and bedding down for the night at the cumberland motel
dees dreams that someone wearing a long black cloak is after him when
dees looks out the patio door however he sees written on the glass in
what looks like blood stay away dees chalks it up to a cemetery
caretaker who gave him a hard time while he was trying to photograph
claire bowies gravesecond stop is new york the alderton funeral home where buck
kendall is laid out ready for the funeral director to sew up the deep
gashes in his face and the two big holes on opposite sides of his neck in
a call that evening to morrison dees learns that morrison is getting
antsy he wants to run the story about the night flier but dees is not
ready to give it yet so morrison has a brainstorm he puts katherine back
on the storythird stop for dees is duffrey maine where ray and ellen sarch were
the night fliers third and fourth victims unfortunately the duffrey
airport is closed so dees has to land at washington national rent a car
and drive into town on the way he comes upon a car crash several people
have been killed and are laying all bloodied on the pavement and in their
cars while photographing a young boy dees sees the boys face suddenly
change into that of an older man with a chain hanging out of his mouth
dees is taken aback but the policeman telling him not to get in the way
interrupts his vision dees stops at a gas station in duffrey the owner tells him how he
filled ray and ellens tank the day before the murders ray was looking
tired and pale but ellen was looking fine the owner suggests that dees
talk to selida mccammon ellens hairdresser selida tells dees that she
thought it odd for ellen after 20 years of appointments as regular as
clockword to suddenly come in two weeks early plus ellen seemed all
dreamy to selida looking like a schoolgirl with a crush and asking for
a new look that made her appear sensuous and younger ellen also told
selida about the pilot who had flown in the night before and how they
welcomed him by inviting him in for dinner and to watch a little tv
after getting the story from the local deputy dees pays a visit to
the sarches trailer he sees rays office where bloody handprints still
remain on the window he sees the corner of the room where rays head was
found ripped from his shoulders he sees on the wall the faa warning for
a black skymaster 337 n101bl registered to dwight renfield he sees the
bedroom where ellen sarchs body was found lying on the bed two big holes
on opposites sides of her neck her body bloodless and a peaceful smile
on her face when he leaves the trailer dees is chased by a large dark
dog who disappears when dees manages to outrun it to his carthat evening after checking in at the falling star motel dees goes
out for a drink or two or three as he looks at the photos he has taken
the bartender sets down an unordered bloody mary supposedly ordered for
dees by a guy at the end of the bar but there is no one there now dees
lifts the drink to see the words stop now printed on the napkin
underneath it when dees returns to his hotel who should he see there but katherine
blair they trade insults boast about their leads and both admit that
theyre actually dry dees invites jimmy to help him phone airports in
search of the night fliers next touchdown they make a list of all the
airports in the area and divide it in half dees calls his half on his
cellphone while katherine calls her half on the phone in the motel room
no luck only one airport to gowilmingtonwhich is unlikely as its a
large airport dees makes the call anyway when he asks the air controller
if hes seen a black cessna skymaster 337 tail 101bl the controller
curtly says no and hangs up on him obviously the real answer is yesfourth stop is wilmington airport but first dees has to get rid of
jimmy he locks her in his closet tells her sorry jimmy you lose
and then takes off alone it is a dark and stormy night as dees approaches
wilmington he asks the controller again if hes seen a skymaster 337
tail 101bl but gets no reply suddenly his radio is filled with screams
then comes a deep gravelly voice calling his name it is dwight renfield
himself he tells dees to turn around but dees refuses when he lands at
wilmington dees sees itthe black skymaster there is no one inside so
dees peeks in what he finds is mindnumbing the cockpit is dripping with
blood and the cargo hold is filled with dirt worms maggots and several
copies of inside viewsuddenly the screaming starts again and dees runs to the terminal
what he finds inside is even more appalling blood everywhere and bodies
of men women and children on the floor and in the chairs even the faa
warning for the black skymaster 337 n101bl registered to dwight renfield
is dripping with blood one body catches his eye and dees goes over to
photograph it it is a man with a chain hanging out of his mouth dees
pulls out the chain to find a crucifix dangling from itdees has had it he can no longer hide behind his camera and races to
the mens room where he upchucks his dinner suddenly someone else enters
the mens room but dees cannot see anyone in the mirror only the trickle
of blood in the urinal where someone is relieving himself it is dwight renfield michael h moss
and for the first time dees realizes that he has encountered a real
vampire dwight makes dees destroy his film warns dees for the final time
not to follow him anymore and leaves after shivering for a few seconds
dees follows anywayshouting at dwight to show his face show it he
does to reveal two huge opposing fangs one on the top and one on the
bottom dwight then slits his own wrist and makes dees drink the bloodand now dees enters his own personal hell the floor of the terminal
turns misty and from it start rising all the people whom dees has
exploited to write his stories in inside view as they advance toward
him dees freaks grabbing the axe from the emergency firebox he starts
hacking at them suddenly the police arrive followed by katherine blair
the police order dees to freeze but he rushes towards katherine anyway
so they shoot him they warn katherine to stay back so she stands by the
terminal window where she sees dwight renfield getting into his black
skymaster and taking offkatherine knows that she can never print what she believes or believe
what she prints so the next cover of inside view features richard dees
lying in a pool of his own blood the headline reads night flier
