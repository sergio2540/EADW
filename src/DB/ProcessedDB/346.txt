trunk of a stolen car where ordell shoots him to deathacting on information livingston had indeed shared after his arrest atf agent ray nicolette michael keaton and lapd detective mark dargus michael bowen intercept jackie as she arrives in the united states with ordells cash and some cocaine that brown was unaware was stashed along with the 30000 cash she initially refuses to cooperate with nicolette and dargus so jackie is sent to jail on possession of drugs with intent to sell sensing that jackie may be just as likely to inform as livingston had been ordell goes back to max cherry and sets out to arrange jackies bail so he can plot to kill her too once she is releasedthat evening max cherry arrives at the jail to pick jackie up and only partly masking his physical attraction offers to buy her a drink and help determine her legal options over drinks at a local bar jackie senses an attraction that max has on her but reminds him that she is not interested after dropping her off at her apartment jackie steals maxs gun that he kept hidden in his glove compartmentlater that night ordell arrives at jackies apartment apparently intending to murder her jackie pulls out the gun she stoleborrowed from cherry and she holds him at gunpoint jackie barters a deal with ordell whereby she will pretend to help the authorities while still managing to smuggle 500000 of ordells money out of mexico enough to allow him to retire and flee to some distant country and retire to carry out this plan ordell employs a woman he lives with my little blond surfer girl a drugaddicted beach bunny named melanie ralston bridget fonda plus his friend louis gara robert de niro a former cellmate whom has shacked up with him ordell also uses a naïve southern girl sheronda lisa gay hamilton as his coconspirator to give him an alibi for when the transaction will take placethe following day jackie meets at lapd headquarters with agent nicolette and detective dargus to arrange a sting to catch ordell but nicollette and dargus are both unaware that jackie and ordell plan to double cross them by diverting the actual money before the authorities make an arrest unbeknownst to the others jackie plans to deceive them both with the help of cherry in order to keep the 500000 for herself however in another twist melanie tries to convince louis to steal the 500000 that jackie will hand over to them and flee the country with the money for themselves though louis agrees he does not trust melanie for she might take all the money for herself out of greed while melanie clearly suspects likewise about louisafter a dry run during which nicolette could observe the operation the stage is set for the actual event told from three different viewpoints a nod to 1950s film noirs the exchange takes place in a large shopping mall near los angeles the del amo fashion centerjackies version at the mall jackie enters the billingsley department store where she buys a new suit and enters a dressing room her real intention is to swap bags there with melanie and louis supposedly passing off the 500000 under nicolettes nose instead she gives melanie only 50000 and leaves the rest behind in the dressing room for max cherry to pick up jackie then feigns despair as she leaves the department store and into the mall where she calls nicolette and dargus out from hiding and claims melanie took all the money and ranlouis and melanies version louis meets melanie at ordells beachfront house while ordell goes to a local barrestaruant called the cockatoo bar with sheronda to have an alibi to his whereabouts for the day melanie gets on louis case from the start when they are late for the rendevouz because louis finds melanie wasting time by getting high in the bathroom with smoking a basepipe during the drive to the mall the stoned melanie annoys louis more by playing loud rock music over the van radio during the switch melanie enters the dressing room at billingsleys with a brown bag of beach towels to make the switch while louis waits outside where he catches a glimpse of max cherry standing nearby melanie exits the dressing room with the other brown bag containing part of the cash in the parking lot melanie gets on louis nerves more and more which finally leads him to shoot and kill her while making their escape after she mouths off one too many timesmax cherrys version max arrives at the mall alone and at the billingsleys department store where he eyes jackie from a distance and tries to hide when louis and melanie walk by to make the switch but louis catches a glimpse of him as they walk by after louis and melanie leave the store jackie pretending to be in dispair pays for her new business suit and leaves the store when jackie leaves max approaches the sales clerk and claims that his wife left a bag in the dressing rooms for him which max picks up the bag containing the 500000 cash and quietly leaves the store where he drives to his office to stash the cash before driving homeacross town louis then picks up ordell from the cockatoo bar where he soon discovers that louis has only 40000 in the bag melanie having kept 10000 for herself after being tricked into doing so by jackie which is apparently left on her dead person then ordell realizes that it was jackie who took his money and in anger a suspicious ordell kills his friend louis he is also concerned about the involvement of max cherry having been told by louis that he spotted max in the store before the pickupat police headquarters agent nicollette is angry with jackie for what transpired during the pickup jackie apparently told him that the money that she was carrying was only 50000 not the entire 500000 from ordells secret account in mexico nicollette tells jackie about finding melanie in the mall parking lot with 10000 on her and about finding louis a short distance away in his van nicollette tells jackie that she has only one more chance to cooperate with them to catch ordell and find the rest of the moneythat evening ordell goes to the cockatoo bar where max is and pulls a gun on him and demands that he help him find jackie who has his money lured back to maxs office where jackie is said to be frightened and waiting to hand over his money ordell arrives armed and dangerous jackie suddenly yells out that ordell has a gun and he is shot by nicolette who was hidden in another roomthree days later in the clear with the law and in possession of the 500000 jackie decides to leave town for a while and she invites max to run off with her max is tempted clearly in love with her as they kiss but he declines to go with jackie for reasons that are left unclearnote there are a number of hints during the movie given by cherry in his dialogue with jackie about why he makes the choices he makes and does not act out of greed some include maxs wanting to get out of the bail bond business and find something else to do to being too old to start a new adventure in life im just tired in general but his reasons for turning down an offer to run off with a woman he is obviously in love with remains intentionally ambiguous at the films closing 7.5money
