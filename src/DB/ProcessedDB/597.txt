information about some of their protected witnesses he goes along but is wary  and with good reason he manages to save lee but realizes that the only way to stop them is to get information from inside cyrez with the help of a mobster kruger once erased they find out exactly what cyrez is up to and try to put a stop to it john kruger works for the witness relocation program as a us marshal his job is to remove all traces of the identity of any witness in the program and to as called for eliminate threats against any of those witnesses john works alone and is the best at what he does when lee

time to save her and relocate later when several witnesses under witsec are killed kruger accompanies another witsec agent deguerin to save a potential victim when they get there deguerin shoots the killer but also kills the witness and then plants a photo of lee in the shooters pocket when kruger sees the photo deguerin asks where she is kruger intially gives him a false location but while on the plane kruger sensing somethings not right calls her which means that she is suppose to meet him somewhere krugers drugged and when he awakens he discovers that deguerin is not only working with the people who are trying to sell the weapons but has just framed him for killing another agent kruger escapes and gets to lee in time but unfortunately he is still a fugitive so he must try and prove
