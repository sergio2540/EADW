flaminia torlonia roberta valli maria wertmuller vadim wolkowsky guido is a film director trying to relax after his last big hit he cant get a moments peace however with the people who have worked with him in the past constantly looking for more work he wrestles with his conscience but is unable to come up with a new idea while thinking he starts to recall major happenings in his life and all the women he has loved and left an autobiographical film of fellini about the trials and tribulations of film making famed director guido anselmi is working on his latest movie  part science fiction part commentary on catholicism but most importantly primarily autobiography despite anselmi declaring that this movie should be an easy one to make he is having problems with his artistic vision specifically as he does not want to tell a lie on screen from the stress he has checked himself into a spa to help him with many of his problems both professional and personal as he works through these problems he reminisces about his childhood and fantasizes about how he either sees things playing out or how he hopes they will play out surrounding him at the spa andor on set are many of the real life people who will be portrayed on screen including his wife luisa who he loves but who he does not fully understand especially as it relates to their marriage his mistress carla the antithesis of luisa and an actress named claudia who he sees as providing his ultimate salvation 8 12 is about guido anselmi an italian director who has lost all inspiration for his upcoming movie and its too late to back out and aside from the fact that he cant make the film his mistress wife producer and all the rest of his friends are pressuring him about one thing or another so he retreats into his dreams to shelter himself from the pressure and there he finds inspiration to make his new film and face the world  8.2director spa mistress actress memory catholicism marriage italian lie
