zane returns home to find his attic devoid of equipment he figures out the only way to broadcast the tape is to go to a nearby telescope and beam the signal directly to a television satellite broadcasting it worldwide with the help of his girlfriend char teri polo and kiki he travels to the telescope phil and his agents soon disable the telescope controls from the main building zane leaves the tape with kiki and instructs him to transmit it when he gives the order and then he and char sneak over to the telescopes base and barricade themselves in the control room zane makes the necessary adjustments and tells kiki to active the tape but kiki reveals himself to be an alien agent and opens the door to allow phil inside and confiscate the tape himself
phil and his agents ram down the door to the telescope room with a van but zane freezes them with cryogenic gases as he works to free the tape stuck in phils frozen jacket one of the agents drops a sphere which starts to form another singularity in the room zane and char escape through the telescopes optical path before the device implodes most of the telescope base exiting safely onto on the collapsed dish in the distance they see kiki and zane tells him to tell the aliens that he will soon broadcast this tape they watch as kiki runs off in the films epilogue zanes conversation with phil is broadcasted across the globe 6.3mexico alien astronomer conspiracy hitchcockian radio signal scientist paranoia escape telescope ambulance husband wife relationship subterranean senator environmentalism face changing restaurant corpse suspense chase bus astronomy central america axe suburbia screwdriver carbon monoxide poisoning computer cracker secret identity seminar sunglasses computer hacker shape shifting alien fired from the job surveillance pistol bathtub satellite dish alien technology black hole terraforming environmental boyfriend girlfriend relationship security guard police station freeze to death liquid nitrogen laboratory airplane marriage problems power station radio station marionette world domination cosmic zoom shapeshifting observatory murder foot chase supernatural power climatologist mask death seti u.s. mexico border hotel alien language gun alien invasion taxi driver security camera golf club handcuffs female sitting on a toilet cover up hitchhiking disguise pay phone greenhouse tape recorder fire scorpion sheriff fake moustache elevator hologram taxi global warming desert police chase henchman telephone bank volkswagen beetle key pirate broadcasting dog independent film surprise ending
