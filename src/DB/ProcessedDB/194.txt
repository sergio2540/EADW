arthur tovey guy way when a mutual friend is killed by a mob boss two con men one experienced and one young try to get even by pulling off the big con on the mob boss the story unfolds with several twists and last minute alterations johnny hooker a small time grifter unknowingly steals from doyle lonnegan a big time crime boss when he pulls a standard street con lonnegan demands satisfaction for the insult after his partner luther is killed hooker flees and seeks the help of henry gondorff one of luthers contacts who is a master of the long con hooker wants to use gondorffs expertise to take lonnegan for an enormous sum of money to even the score since he admits he doesnt know enough about killing to kill him they devise a complicated scheme and amass a talented group of other con artists who want their share of the reparations the stakes are high in this game and our heroes must not only deal with lonnegans murderous tendencies but also other side players who want a piece of the action to win hooker and gondorff will need all their skillsand a fair amount of confidence johnny hooker is a young conman who is being taught by luther one day they pull one of their con jobs and net themselves a huge roll what they dont know is that the man they conned is the courier for a numbers runner and it turns out that the boss doyle lonigan considers it an attack on him and orders all the people involved terminated hooker is shaken down by a crooked cop snyder who threatens to turn him over to lonigan unless he pays him off hooker pays him he then tries to warn luther but is too late he then goes to see henry gondorf a friend of luthers and a one time great conman who has had a bit of bad luck after hearing what happened to luther and seeing how hungry hooker is for payback he assembles a gang and decides to con lonigan while everything seems to be going ok there is just the problem of the hit on hooker and snyder whom hooker paid off with counterfeit money its september 1936 the place joliet illinois luther coleman his apprentice johnny hooker and their underling joe eries latest swindle has netted them 11000 enough for an aged luther to contemplate retiring from

gondorff his old friend in chicago to learn the art of the big con hooker does contact gondorff who has retired after being burned in his last big con gondorff decides to come out of retirement solely to help hooker get back at lonnegan for luthers murder in pulling off the big con gondorff and hooker require the assistance of a number of gondorffs old associates as well as a number of small time grifters in the latter group includes erie who wants to do his small part in revenging luthers death beyond lonnegan or anyone else finding out about the con there are many potential obstacles in pulling off the sting such as a controlling and overly cautious lonnegan wanting to do things his own way and a number of people chasing after hooker including a crooked joliet vice cop named snyder lonnegans lower level thugs and a hired hit man through the process hooker who sees himself as being a wheeler dealer may come across a better deal than that provided to him by gondorff it is 1932 and a money runner is carrying the weeks take  11000  from an illegal gambling outfit in joliet illinois to the main office on the way three men con him by replacing his money with tissue paper doyle

into a highstakes poker game with lonnegan who is known to cheat gondorff cheats better and wins 15000 from lonnegan  but lonnegan cant pay it right away because his wallet is missing one of gondorffs associates picked his pocket before the game gondorff sends hooker to lonnegans room to pick up the money hooker playing gondorffs resentful secondincommand tells lonnegan he has a great plan to con gondorff but he needs someone respectable to place the bets lonnegan furious at being outcheated bitesgondorff and company do a lot of fast work to get ready for the final phase of the long con first they assemble a mob and rent an empty basement transforming it in a couple of days into a prosperous gambling parlor an announcer in a back room describes horse races as if they were happening live  but hes reading from a ticker tape so the results are known in advance they choose a race with odds they like  maybe 31 or 41  and call in a tip a particular horse or horses to win place or show to the pay phone at the corner drugstore where lonnegan is waiting gondorffs gang has also rented a room with a view of the corner drugstore when lonnegan comes out on his way to the gambling den a watcher rings a buzzer to warn them hes coming they run through this once with a fairly small bet to show lonnegan the system will work the final plan they give lonnegan calls for a bet so large it will ruin gondorff they run into trouble when lonnegan demands to meet hookers imaginary accomplice hooker has told lonnegan the key to the scam is his friend at western union who gives him race results by phone before theyre released over the wire pretending to be painters the gang tricks a genuine western union manager into vacating his office for an hour and one of them poses as the manager lonnegan is convincedmeanwhile lonnegans goons have tracked hooker to chicago but failed to kill him they  and lonnegan  have no idea that the man lonnegan is helping to con gondorff is the same guy who helped luther take the runners money at the beginning of the movie lonnegan assigns the job to someone called solino who its implied is a very skilled assassinlt snyder charles durning a joliet cop has pursued hooker to the big city because hooker gave snyder counterfeit cash when snyder tried to shake him down snyder isnt getting very far when hooker cant stay out of snyders way entirely he can outrun him snyder is induced to assist fbi agent polk dana elcar whos after gondorff snyder collars hooker and brings him to polk who pressures him to give up gondorff by threatening to lock up luthers wife hooker who was close to luthers family gives in provided the fbi will let the lonnegan con run its course before arresting gondorffthe night before the final act of the con hooker hooks up with loretta dimitra arliss the new waitress at the diner where he likes to eat when he wakes up shes gone hes somewhat puzzled to find that she hasnt robbed him he dresses fits something we dont get a good look at over his back teeth and goes out a man whom weve seen only glimpses of before now is stalking hooker with a gun as hooker walks down a sunlit alley and spots loretta coming toward him smiling the armed man emerges behind him and shoots  hitting loretta neatly in the middle of the forehead she drops a handgun as she falls hooker stunned listens to the gunmans explanation that loretta solino is a pro  a hired killer  and she hadnt killed him the night before because witnesses had seen him entering her apartment to hookers bewildered who are you the gunman replies gondorff asked me to look after youlonnegan with half a million dollars in a suitcase receives his tip in the drugstore and goes to gondorffs gambling parlor to place the bet the betting clerk needs gondorffs approval to accept such a large bet theres some taunting and snarling between gondorff and lonnegan before gondorff accepts it lonnegan sits down to listen to the race hes joined by kid twist harold gould the faux western union manager whos been calling in lonnegans tips when lonnegan mentions that he bet on the tipped horse to win kid twist shocked tells him the bet should have been to place not to win in a panic lonnegan tries to rescind the wager but its too latewhile lonnegan is shouting the fbi bursts in to arrest gondorff having secured the mastermind his prize polk tells hooker he can go hooker throws a guilty look at gondorff and starts to slink away but gondorff pulls a gun and shoots him in the back polk shoots gondorff lonnegan standing nearby can see that hooker is bleeding from the mouth both men look quite dead lt snyder whose job is to get lonnegan away as quickly as possible duly hustles him out telling him he doesnt want to be mixed up with dead bodiesback in the gambling den good cheer reigns the dead have risen and are congratulating one another and their many accomplices  including the erstwhile fbi agents  for a job well done
