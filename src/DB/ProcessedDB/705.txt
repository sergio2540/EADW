glamorous onscreen couple lina lamont and don lockwood are also an offscreen couple if the trade papers and gossip columns are to be believed both perpetuate the public perception if only to please their adoring fans and bring people into the movie theaters in reality don barely tolerates her while lina despite thinking don beneath her simplemindedly believes what she sees on screen in order to bolster her own stardom and sense of selfimportance rf simpson monumentals head dismisses what he thinks is a flash in the pan talking pictures it isnt until in 1927 don lockwood and lina lamont are a famous onscreen romantic pair lina however mistakes the onscreen romance for real love don has worked hard to get where he is today with his former partner cosmo when don and linas latest film is transformed into a musical don has the perfect voice for the songs but lina  well even with the best efforts of a diction coach they still decide to dub over her voice kathy selden is brought in an aspiring actress and while she is working on the movie don falls in love with her will kathy continue to aspire or will she get the break she deserves  in 1927 the former stunt don lockwood becomes a successful actor with the company of his best friend cosmo brown forming a romantic pair with the actress lina lamont in the period of transition from silent movies to talking pictures don accidentally meets the aspirant actress kathy selden while escaping from his fans and fall in love for her lina has troubles with the sharp tune of her voice and cosmo and don decides to dub her using kathys voice to save their movie when the jealous lina finds the strategy of the studio she does not want to share the credits with kathy and tries to force the studio to use kathy in the shadow to dub her in other productions but when lina decides to speech and sing to the audience the truth arises 1927 don lockwood and lina lamont are the darlings of the silent silver screen offscreen don aided by his happygolucky friend and piano accompanist cosmo brown has to dodge linas romantic overtures especially when he falls for chorus girl kathy selden with the advent of sound in motion pictures it is decided to turn don and linas new film into a talkie and a musical at that the only problem is linas voice which mere words cannot describe thus kathy is brought on to dub her speaking and singing voice in secret and dons on top of the world but then lina finds out don lockwood gene kelly is a popular silent film star with humble roots as a singer dancer and stunt man don barely tolerates his vapid shallow leading lady lina lamont jean hagen who has convinced herself that the fake romance their studio concocted and publicized is realone day to escape from overenthusiastic fans don jumps into a passing car driven by kathy selden debbie reynolds she drops him off but not before claiming to be a stage actress and sneering at his undignified accomplishments as a cinema actor later at a party the head of dons studio rf simpson millard mitchell shows a short demonstration of a talking picture but his guests are unimpressed don runs into kathy again at the party to his amusement and her embarrassment he discovers that kathy is only a chorus girl part of the entertainment furious she throws a pie at him only to hit lina right in the face later don makes up with kathy and they begin falling in loveafter the first talking picture the jazz singer proves to be a smash hit rf decides he has no choice but to convert the new lockwood and lamont film the dueling cavalier into a talkie the production is beset with difficulties most if not all taken from real life by far the worst being linas comically grating voice a test screening is a disaster in one scene for instance don repeats i love you to lina over and over to the audiences derisive laughter a reference to a scene by john gilbert in his first talkie2dons best friend cosmo brown donald oconnor comes up with the idea to overdub linas voice with kathys and they persuade rf to turn the dueling cavalier into a musical called the dancing cavalier when lina finds out that kathy is dubbing her voice she is furious and does everything possible to sabotage the romance between don and kathy she is even more irate when she discovers that kathy will receive screen credit and a big publicity campaign so she blackmails rf into withholding credit and later demands that kathy a contract player continue to do so in the futurethe premiere of the dueling cavalier is a tremendous success when the audience clamors for lina to sing live don cosmo and rf improvise and get lina to lipsynch while kathy sings into a second microphone while hidden behind the curtain unbeknownst to lina as she starts singing don cosmo and rf gleefully open the curtain behind her revealing the deception lina flees in embarrassment when kathy tries to run away as well don has her stopped and introduces the audience to the real star of the filmdan and kathy start singing a love song final cue of they both kissing in front of a huge billboard advertising the film singin in the rain with don lockwood and kathy selden
