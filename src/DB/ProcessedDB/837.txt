normalcy is squelched by sudden crowds eager to meet him ann and norton locate him john isnt happy about it when norton offers him a lecture tour he refuses it angrily when the common people who have a john doe club talk to him however he softens when hearing how hes touched them now johns torn his itinerant pal the colonel thinks hes been hooked and disgusted walks out on himnorton arranges the lecture tour john speaks in state after state addressing the many national clubs in his name connell tells norton however that hes curious why norton is spending so much money on the tour in the meantime ann knowing that john now likes her feels increasingly like the heel she feels she is she feels even worse when john relates a tender dream that he had about her and talks to her about how he relates to the lonely hungry people to whom hes been speakingnorton gives ann a fur coat and a gift he then tells her that he wants john doe to announce a new third political party which its clear to ann was nortons plan all along norton wants to be the presidential candidate for that party which will be less for the people than it is for those like norton  big business types john visits anns mother telling her hed like to marry ann her gentle advice is just to askwhile john talks with connell the editor whos had a few drinks blurts that norton has a dark agenda john feels hurt and used as hed felt the whole john doe was legitimate not a tool for nortons political ambitions connell also tells john how well paid ann is to write the speeches and would do anything for money angry john walk in on norton and ann at a lavish dinner party hes having in his mansion john overhears nortons political plotting as well as his toast to ann for having aided him ann sees that john is listeningjohn asks ann if indeed she wrote nortons speech and she admits it john then confronts norton and all at his party john threatens to thwart his efforts norton accuses john of being the fake not him norton threatens to reveal such if he talks aghast that norton would kill the john doe movement to protect his own interests john is furious with all of them he tells them off with passion impressing ann and the staff who overhear john feels that the movement is far too powerful for norton and his cronies to stopnorton wants john stopped before he can blow the whistle at the huge gathering that has now formed at a public arena ann catches up with john trying to explain telling him that she didnt know what norton and his people were dong john doesnt believe her and doesnt allow her to accompany him

mike cords ann listens on the radio as the mob becomes unruly john returns to his place beneath a bridge with the colonelnewspapers herald his fakery clubs disband john feels disgraced hes tortured by memories of the sweet simple people that he feels he now let down christmas eve comes the appointed time that john doe was to take his life by leaping from the building some of his followers are convinced hell jump so they head for the roof as does annindeed john shows up a letter in his hand addressed to the admirers he feels he let down hes about to jump when norton steps from the shadows with this men telling him that if he jumps the mayor has been instructed to remove his id and thus his suicide will be for nothing but john tells him hes already mailed a copy of the letter elsewhere
