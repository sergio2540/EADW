he invites holly to stay and give lecture in a few days at the departments meeting figuring he could use the extra time in town as an opportunity to look into harrys death holly accepts the offerholly

recognizes kurtz ernst deutsch as one of the two men at harrys funeral kurtz is carrying one of hollys books which he says harry had given to him and a small dogholly proceeds to grill kurtz about the circumstances of harrys death kurtz and martins go out to the street in front of harrys apartment building to reconstruct the events of the accident kurtzs version is this he was walking out of harrys flat with him when harry saw a romanian friend of his popescu across the street harry then began to cross the street to greet popescu when a truck drove up and ran harry over then kurtz and popescu carried harry to the sidewalk shortly thereafter harrys doctor dr winkel happened by the doctor was too late to save harry however holly asks kurtz to help him investigate further but kurtz says as he is an austrian he must be careful with the police martins tells him the police think harry was a racketeer kurtz points out most everyone in vienna is mixed up in some sort of racket but mostly nothing serioustires stamps etckurtz describes how after harry was hit he instructed him to see after holly when he arrived holly points out the porter who is near them outside the apartment sweeping told him that harry died instantaneously kurtz looks the porter over and says that harry died before the ambulence arrived but that he was still alive immediately after he was run over holly tells kurtz he wants to speak to popescu but he says popescu has left vienna at hollys insistence kurtz tells him the identity of the pretty woman at the funeral he does not remember her name but he tells holly she was a companion of harrys who works as an actress at a local theater kurtz tells holly he lives in the russian sector but works at the casanova club and if he has any need for advice to contact him there holly then tries to question the porter again however the porters wife overhearing the conversation looks frightened and calls for her husband to come insidethat evening holly goes to theater where the woman named anna schmidt is performing he introduces himself as a friend of harry limes and she tells him to come back after the show when he meets her afterwards martins finds out that anna so depressed over harrys death that she declares she wishes she too were dead had been dating harry for some time and that harry had allegedly asked kurtz that anna be taken care of as well just before he died martins thinks it funny that harry had time to think of both him and anna right after the accident even though he supposedly died instantly or at least very quickly anna also reveals that the man driving the truck was harrys own driver holly tells anna that he has a feeling that theres something suspicous about harrys death  that seemingly everyone he knew was at the scene  and he convinces her to help him speak to the porter againanna and holly go to talk with the porter in harrys apartment anna pokes around the flat seemingly reminiscing and halfheartedly translates the german for martins the porter tells them that harrys neck was broken in such a way that he had to have died immediately therefore there was no way he could have asked kurtz that anna and martins be taken care of he also says that three men carried harry to the sidewalk not two kurtz  popescu as kurtz had claimed holly asks the porter why he did not reveal this information at the inquest and the porter responds he didnt want to be mixed up in the situation and that he wasnt the only witness who did not give a complete testimony as holly tries to convince the porter take his story to the police the conversation becomes heated the porter who becomes fearful insists in german that holly leave and never come back an elfin boy spies them arguing just before holly and anna leaveholly walks anna back to her place and they are met by annas landlady hedwig bleibtreu who frantically tells her that the police are inspecting her apartment holly and anna go upstairs to find major calloway and sergeant paine supervising as her apartment is torn apart calloway asks for her passport which he and paine inspect and then suspect is fake the major tells her he must keep it holly tells calloway that he suspects harry may have been murdered but he says he doesnt care how harry died as long hes dead he suggests holly should go back to the airport and go home as they continue to go through her things including love letters to her from harry anna explains quietly to holly about her passport which she reveals harry forged for her she explains that she is czechoslovakian and that the russians would claim her and have her deported if it was found out that she was not austrian calloway takes anna back with the other officers to the police station and on her way out holly asks her to remind him of harrys doctors name so he can go talk with himholly goes to ask dr winkel erich ponto about harrys death the doctor was the man standing by kurtz at the funeral in his home holly sees the same small dog that kurtz was carrying earlier the doctor tersely adheres to kurtzs take on the events and he confirms that he arrived after harry was already dead holly asks if its possible that harry was pushed in front of the truck if he knows if harry could have died instantaneously or not and if there was a third man who helped carry harrys body to the sidewalk dr winkel tells holly he can give no additional opinion as to the circumstances of the accident since he did not witness the event and the injuries would have been the same no matter how it happened he also says there was no third man on the scene by the time he arrivedat the international police station anna sees a russian officer flipping through her papers as she waits calloway comes in and questions her about harry he shows her a picture of man named joseph harbin and asks if she knows who he is anna says shes never seen him before he explains that harbin is a worker in a military hospital but she insists she does not know him he accuses her of lying which he says is stupid because he could help her with her passport he explains that in one of her confiscated letters harry had written her to instruct her to place a call to the casanova club for someone named joseph anna barely remembers that the message for joseph was something about meeting harry at his home calloway tells her that the day she telephoned that message to joseph harbin he disappeared anna insists calloway has harry all wrong and he sends her away though he keeps her passport and belongingsanna then goes with holly who was waiting outside the station for her to the casanova club crabbin is inside just leaving and he reminds holly of the lecture he is to give the next night holly and anna sit at the bar and see kurtz playing violin for a dining couple kurtz looks dismayed to see holly again and when questioned insists that only he and popescu carried harry and that the porter must have been mistaken kurtz says that popescu happens to be at the club that night despite his earlier claim that popescu was out of town holly meets popescu siegfried breuer whose account of harrys death mirrors kurtzs account in all aspects holly again asks if a third man helped him and kurtz carry harrys body but popescu denies this asking where holly heard such a thing he tells him the porter at harrys building had heard the accident and witnessed the aftermath this is evidently news to popescu who was unaware that the porter was a witness since he had not given testimony at the inquestpopescu is then seen arranging and attending a mysterious meeting on a bridge with kurtz dr winkel and an unseen fourth manthe following morning while holly wanders thoughtfully in front of harrys former home the porter leans out the window and apologizes to holly for his previous demeanor arranging to meet with him later to tell him something important when the porter closes the window and turns around he reacts with surprise and terror to an unseen person who has presumably snuck up behind himholly goes to visit anna to tell her the porter wants to talk to him again she is especially depressed about harry and she begs holly to tell her stories about him they talk about harry painting him as a mischevous boy who never grew up she insists they go see the porter together accidently calling him harry which lightly miffs hollyas they walk up to the front of the porters building they see a crowd gathered near the door anna immediately wants to leave assuming it to be trouble holly however walks over to the crowd where he is told the porter has been murdered the little boy who had seen holly and the porter arguing begins insisting something about holly loudly in german slowly the assembled crowd turns to stare at holly anna explains that the crowd thinks he is the murderer he grabs anna and they run away the crowd pursues them with the little boy in the lead holly and anna duck into a movie theater losing the mob holly tells anna to go back home where shell be safeholly eventually makes his way back to his hotel where he asks the desk clerk for a taxi driver the clerk indicates that an imposinglooking man standing there is a driver already waiting for him with holly in the back seat the driver speeds off recklessly without holly saying where he wants to go holly very frightened asks him if he is taking him to be killed the driver does not answer and finally stops in front of a doorway holly sure that hes about to be murdered starts to run but the door opens crabbin greets him and holly realizes it is time for the speaking engagement that hed agreed toholly struggles with the intellectual questions posed to him the audience begins to dissipate while crabbin agonizes over the misstep of hiring holly unexpectedly popescu arrives and he asks holly if hes working on a book holly says that hes writing a book called the third man and that its based on fact popescu suggests that holly stick to fiction but holly insists he will finish this book as the meeting is closed two thuggishlooking men arrive and get whispered orders from popescu holly takes off up the spiral staircase at the back of the building and the two thugs pursue him holly ducks into in unlocked room where he is bitten by an unexpected parrot he makes his way out of a window and finds refuge from the thugs in a car hidden among the wartime rubbleonce safe holly goes to the international police station to tell calloway about his findings calloway though now convinced that harry lime was murdered is still indifferent and explains that its better that harry is dead holly insists he is wrong so the major offers to show holly why he believes harry is guilty of racketeering and murder calloway then presents a myriad of evidence proving that harry obtained penicillin illegally dilluted it and sold it to warravaged poor hospitals resulting in the painful deaths of many people watereddown penicillin is not only ineffective but it also makes the patient immune to future doses of penicillin thus rendering medical treatment incredibly difficult or impossible many of his victims were children with meningitis the lucky ones the major says died and the unlucky ones lived and went insane he shows holly a slide of the hospital worker joseph harbin who he explains helped steal the penicillin for harry the police forced harbin to give them information about harrys operation but he has recently gone missing holly now convinced of harrys guilt is devastated by the news about his old friend and agrees to go back to americaafter holly goes out to a bar and gets drunk he buys flowers and takes them to anna in her apartment he drunkenly calls to annas cat who is indifferent to him and anna explains the only person the cat ever liked was harry the cat slips out the window anna lets holly know that calloway also told her about harrys misdeeds and though she now believes in his guilt as well it doesnt change her feelings for harrywe then see a man outside annas window on the street he ducks into a dark doorway annas cat who has run out of the apartment curls up at his feetin the apartment anna says harry is better off dead but not because he was punished for doing wrong as calloway believes holly agrees hes better off dead and he no longer cares who killed him or why he believes there was justice in harrys death and he says maybe he would have even killed harry himself he also tells anna that hes fallen in love with her but she makes it apparent that the feeling isnt mutual as she thinks only of harrydisappointed and still drunk holly stumbles outside to return to his hotel but he sees the obscured man standing in the dark doorway the cat still at his feet holly shouts at him to stop spying and to show himself but he does not move hollys noise causes a woman upstairs to turn on her light and open her window to yell at him to be quiet the light from the womans apartment shines down into the street revealing the man in the doorway to be harry lime orson welles harry smiles at a shocked holly but slips away when the woman turns off her light seeing harrys shadow running off down a nearby street holly takes pursuit he follows the sound of footsteps down a passageway that opens into a plaza but once holly reaches the end of the passageway harry is already goneholly brings calloway and paine out the area to reenact the events but they are unconvinced however suddenly a light bulb goes off for calloway as he eyes a booth in the plaza opening the door on the booth calloway shows holly that it is an entranceway to the vienna sewers with steps leading downwards they follow the stairs into the sewers where they see an endless range of tunnels for harry to use as escape routesthat night calloway leads a team to excavate harrys grave when they open the coffin the body inside is revealed to be that of joseph harbinthe international police come to annas apartment for her as she lies in bed crying in harrys old pajamas anna surely assumes this is because of her forged papers as she is led into the station holly sees her and yells at her that hes seen harry alive calloway is standing in the hallway as the police lead her through the station and he instructs them to bring her into his office he interrogates her alone asking when she saw lime last he explains in his coffin was joseph harbins body she looks thrilled as she realizes this does mean that harry is alive and she asks where he is calloway thinks she might know but it is clear she was not aware he has been alive either he says they know harry is hiding in the russian sector which is where kurtz lives as he told holly and that if she helps them catch lime calloway will help her with the russians who are about to interrogate her about her passport she cannot help him though and he tells her they will catch him eventually as vienna is a closed city she says that she wishes that he was dead as he would be safe from all of youthe next morning holly goes to visit baron kurtzs apartment in the russian sector kurtz looks over his balcony and invites holly up but holly refuses as he shouts back that he wants to speak only with harry dr winkel comes out on the balcony also and he and kurtz exchange concerned looks though they admit nothing about harry holly insists that he come meet him at the nearby fairgroundsas holly waits next to the ferris wheel he spots harry walking up to warmly greet him acting as if nothing has changed they go for a ride on the ferris wheel harry shows no remorse for his penicillin racket asking holly about the people far below them if holly would really care if one of those little dots stopped moving forever especially if he were paid each dot when holly reveals that he told the police about seeing harry harry is very unhappy that holly has been talking to the cops harry staring at holly clearly considers shooting him and throwing him out of the ferris wheel to his death holly takes him seriously enough to wrap his arm tightly around the car door should harry try anything however when holly also says that theyve dug up his grave and found harbin harry changes his mind and jokes that neither one of them would ever think of doing something to the other harry also reveals that he was the one who informed the russian police about annas forged passport as payment for them letting him hide out in the russian sector as they finish the ride harry offers to cut holly in on his schemes but without waiting for an answer harry leaves quickly telling him that they can meet again any time he wants but no policeholly goes to meet with calloway and tells him he knows where harry is staying the major tries to convince him to help them trap harry by arranging to meet him at a cafe in the international zone however though holly knows his friend has done wrong he is unwilling to be the one to doom him just then the russian officer comes in with annas passport explaining to calloway that she must be deported the major mentions to him that the russians were supposed to be helping the british police with harry lime but the russian says the two cases are not related and that they will get to his case eventually he leaves the room annas passport sitting on calloways desk calloway seemingly resigned to holly giving up in harrys case talks about how helpful holly could have been in getting lime but holly is staring at annas papers sitting on the desk holly asks what price would calloway pay for his help and he tells him to name itpaine accompanies anna to board the train that will save her from the russian authorities just as she settles into her car she spies holly trying to see her off inconspicuously understanding that her leaving must have been part of a deal holly struck with calloway she gets off the train and confronts holly about why hes there he admits he has agreed to betray harry in turn for her getting away anna makes it evident that shes disgusted with holly and could never do anything to hurt harry she leaves angrily ripping up her passport and allows the train to depart with her belongingsnow despondent holly asks that calloway and paine just take him to the airport having changed his mind to help them catch harry he shows them annas torn up papers calloway agrees but on the way to the airport the major makes an extra stop it is the childrens ward of a hospital where calloway shows holly the devastating effects of harrys dilluted penicillin horrified by the sight of painfully dying children holly reluctantly agrees again to entrap harryat a cafe holly waits to meet harry while calloway paine and several other policemen stake out nearby in the shadows anna comes into the cafe to admonish holly his location disclosed to her by baron kurtz as he was being arrested while she talks to him harry has snuck in the back of the cafe just as harry enters behind anna she yells at holly for being a police informant harry reacts drawing a gun to shoot holly anna is standing in the way and tells harry that he must escape or the police will get him harry tells anna to move so he can kill holly but he spots sergeant paine entering the front of the cafe and turns to runharry rushes to the nearest sewer entrance and goes down into the tunnels paine calloway holly and international policemen pursue harry through the maze of sewer passages harry for a time evades the many men but he is eventually cornered holly happens upon the panicked harry and hiding from the range of harrys gun tells him that he must give up sergeant paine followed by calloway comes rushing to holly to warn him to get back but harry shoots paine and he falls harry tries to run but is shot by callowayharry manages to crawl out of sight while calloway leans over the dying paine holly takes paines gun and sets off after harry and calloway tells him to shoot on sight in a passageway badly wounded harry strains to climb up steps to escape through a sewer grate he manages to make it to the top of the staircase where he reaches his fingers up through the grate feeling the air above however he is too weak to lift the manhole cover and he drops his head into his arms holly walks up and aims the gun at harry harry weakly lifts his head and nods slightly at holly a silent okay for holly to mercykill him a shot rings out in the sewers calloway sees the figure of holly emerging from the passageway alonesoon after harry again has another funeral in the same cemetery holly calloway and anna are the only attendees after the service calloway begins to drive holly to the airport seeing anna walking behind them down the same treelined trail as the first time he saw her holly asks to get out to speak to her holly waits for anna as she walks down the long road toward him when she nears him though she does not acknowledge his presence and walks by holly doesnt say anything but he
