stay alive long enough to see in the millennium los angeles december 30th 1999the story opens with a man saying ok hit me theres a burst of tv static and the scene shifts immediately to a group of three men riding in a car they are handing out pistols to each other and covering their faces with nylon stockings the man in the back seat pulls a stocking over his head and it covers his pointofview we realize we are witnessing the event as it happens to him through his perspectivethe car stops at a convenience store and the men rush in quickly pacifying customers and the asian owners of the store they empty the cash register and force one of the owners to empty the safe the hostages are eventually herded into a food locker and are locked inside as the robbers try to leave through the front entrance of the store they run straight into several policemen one of the men decides to take his chances and rushes the cops the two remaining robbers are chased back through the store and out a back door which leads to a staircase they climb the stairs rapidly with the cops in fast pursuit behind them they reach the roof where a helicopter shines a light on them one of the robbers jumps across to another roof and lands safely the man whose perspective we have been watching is unable to make the jump and ends up hanging on the edge while his buddy frantically tries to pull him up the cops arrive and fire a few shots and the robber loses his grip on the ledge and plummets to the ground a burst of static is seen and we see blacknessat that moment lenny nero who has been watching a

recordings he has to selllenny himself deals in a virtual realitytype of recording where people record their personal experiences that can be played back by anyone lenny sells them to the slang for the experience is called jacking in lennys argument for selling the recordings is that they allow anyone to experience life events without having to actually participate especially in illegal activity or extramarital affairs the technology used to create the recordings was developed by law enforcement for evidence gathering and is illegal to buy or sell in the civilian sector lenny meets with a potential client and nearly has him convinced to buy his product when hes accosted by a cop who turns out to be his friend max the client is scared off and max treats lenny to a drink lenny it turns
