nero dennis ott nanci rogers kimberly l ryusaki rebecca soladay philip weyland following kirks encounter with khan that left the enterprise severely damaged and spock dead they return to starfleet so that enterprise could be repaired kirks hoping to go back to the newlycreated genesis planet where he laid spock to rest but upon arriving he is told that the enterprise will not be repaired and that genesis has become a delicate matter and until it is resolved no one is allowed to go there or talk about it mccoy is also acting strangely and is later detained when he starts talking about genesis kirk is visited by spocks father sarek who tells him that he betrayed spock because being placed on genesis was not what he would have wanted he tells kirk he is supposed to bring spocks body along with his soul or katra as the vulcans call it which he passes onto someone and bring it to vulcan for the final rites sarek assumes kirk would have it but he does not kirk then thinks that spock may have passed it someone else and realizes mccoy is the one who has which is why he is acting weird sarek tells kirk he must bring both spocks body and mccoy who has his soul to vulcan so that they could be at peace kirk asks permission but his request is refused kirk then along with the others decides to take the enterprise and proceed to genesis to get spocks body but what they do not know is that the klingons who upon learning of genesis sets out to get it so they go there and destroy the science vessel sent to evaluate genesis they capture lieutenant saavik and kirks son david who go to the planet and discover that spock was somehow regenerated and that the planet is aging rapidly in the wake of spocks ultimate deed of sacrifice the enterprise and crew are returning to earth for some essential repairs to their ship when they arrive in spacedock they are shocked to discover that the enterprise is to be decommissioned dr mccoy begins acting strangely and scotty is being reassigned to another ship kirk is forced to steal back the enterprise and fly across space to the genesis planet to save spock and bring him to vulcan however the klingons have also learned of genesis and set out to intercept kirk in a deadly confrontation with most of the enterprises battle damage repaired after defeating khan at genesis the ships crew returns home to bad news from starfleet commander morrow the enterprise is to be decommissioned even worse dr mccoy begins acting bizarrely and scotty is being reassigned to another ship a visit to kirk from sarek  spocks father and the vulcan ambassador  reveals that mccoy is carrying spocks katra or living spirit immediately kirk meets with admiral morrow to plead for permission to return to genesis and rescue spock when permission is denied kirk and his crew steal the enterprise and head for genesis  by now a quarantined planet unknown to them the klingons led by the ruthless commander kruge are planning to steal the secrets of genesis for their own twisted purpose the enterprise is crippled in a fight with the klingon ship and worse the klingons murder kirks son who was among the science team that rescued spock kirk eliminates the remaining klingons by tricking them aboard the enterprise and then blowing it up with the autodestruct then steals the klingon birdofprey and heads for vulcan for a ceremony to refuse spocks body and katra admiral kirks defeat of khan and the creation of the genesis planet are empty victories spock is dead and dr mccoy is seemingly inexplicably being driven insane then an unexpected visit from spocks father sarek provides a startling revelation mccoy is harboring spocks living essence with one friend alive and one not but both in pain kirk attempts to help his friends by stealing the enterprise and defying starfleets genesis quarantine but the klingons have also learned of genesis and race to meet kirk in a deadly rendezvous the uss enterprise having survived its battle with khan noonien singh is returning to earth with a few hours left in their journey kirk remarks in his log that there is a heavy feeling amongst the crew on the ship having lost their science officer captain spock whom sacrificed himself to insure the enterprise would not be destroyed by khan kirk has uhura check for a hailing signal from starfleet but finds there isnt one when asked by a cadet if they will receive a heros welcome at home kirk thinks they will since theyve paid with their dearest bloodin a remote area of space a klingon female valkris waits on a small freighter for a signal from her commanding officer commander kruge responds and valkris transmits stolen data to him on the genesis project when asked by kruge if she had seen the information she replies she had kruges ship a klingon birdofprey deactivates its cloaking device and swings into attack blasting apart the freighter and flying offat earth the enterprise arrives at the orbiting spacedock while the ship docks the crew catches sight of the fleets newest and most advanced ship excelsior sulu remarks that excelsior has a new technology called transwarp drive a skeptical mr scott is scornful however kirk scolds him gently saying young minds fresh ideas a warning alarm suddenly sounds someone has broken into mr spocks quarters which kirk had ordered sealed kirk goes there himself and finds dr mccoy whom appears to be suffering from mental trauma he tells kirk that he left him back on genesis and that he has to climb the steps of mount selaya on the planet vulcan mccoy collapses unconscious and kirk calls for the medicsback on kruges ship he and his first officer study the genesis materials and determine that it can be an invincible weapon he orders a course set for the genesis planeton earth the crew of the enterprise is not given a ceremonial reception they are received by admiral morrow who has nothing but bad news for them kirk will not be allowed to return to the genesis planet to retrieve spocks body project genesis has become a galactic controversy and only the science teams will be allowed access to the planet the crew are sworn to secrecy regarding the subject scotty will be transferred to the excelsior to help with engineering development on the new ship worst of all the enterprise is to be decommissioned from serviceonboard the uss grissom one of starfleets science vessels dr david marcus and lt saavik approach the genesis planet they scan the surface of the planet and find varying environmental conditions they also locate the photon tube in which spocks body was sent to the planets surface during his funeral services they ask permission to beam down to the planet a request that captain esteban is reluctant to allow he eventually gives them permissionback on earth at kirks apartment he and his comrades share a drink honoring spock they also discuss mccoys condition who is noticeably absent and allegedly sedated in a medical facility kirk answers a ring at his door and is surprised to see spocks father the vulcan ambassador sarek kirk asks his friends to leave and talks privately with sarek who is quite upset with kirk for leaving spock behind sarek speaks of spocks vulcan katra his soul that can possibly be returned to his body saying that spock wouldnt have spoken openly about his final wishes he asks kirk to allow a mindmeld with him sarek recounts kirks and spocks final moments together but does not find a trace of spocks katra as he starts to leave kirk stops sarek and tells him that even in a situation as desperate as the neardestruction of the enterprise and spocks efforts to prevent it spock would have transferred his katra to someone kirk reviews the ships recording of spocks last conversation with dr mccoy and sees that spock had mindmelded with him after rendering him unconscious sarek tells kirk that he must bring both mccoy and spock to mount selaya on vulcan where a ritual can be performed to restore spocks mind to his body kirk says it will be difficult but he will attempt the rescueon genesis david and saavik find spocks photon tube his burial robe inside the tube is also covered with a strange species of slimy orange creature david deduces that they are the evolutionary descendants of microbes present on the tube before it was sent to the planet they also notice that the weather conditions on the planet change very rapidly they hear a childs cry coming from a nearby cave and find a young vulcan boy spock they dress him again in his robe and contact grissom about the discovery however esteban has to cut off communication with them when kruges birdofprey enters the sector and attacks kruges gunner fires a torpedo at grissom obliterating it in a fit of anger over being denied federation hostages kruge shoots his gunner with a blaster disintegrating him his officer torg tells him that there are members of grissoms crew on the genesis planet below and that hell still have a chance to take prisoners kruge beams down with two of his crew and they search for saavik and david they reach the photo tube and find huge lampreylike creatures the next evolution of the small creatures david and saavik found earlier they pick up david and saaviks signal on a scanner and head toward themon earth kirk asks admiral morrow to allow him to return to the genesis planet to rescue spock morrow refuses citing that genesis is off limits and a forbidden subject he also expresses doubt about what he calls vulcan mysticism kirk acts as though he sees morrows point and agrees not to attempt a voyage to genesis outside the bar where he met morrow he finds his friends and tells them that despite morrows refusal theyll go ahead with their plans in another bar dr mccoy meets with an alien pilot to arrange his own charter to genesis the alien who has a booming voice speaks loudly enough to get mccoy noticed by federation officers that have followed him they arrest him and put him in the brig after making his arrangements for travel kirk visits mccoy in his cell and tells him about spocks mind meld mccoy is given a tranquilizer and sulu using martial arts subdues the guards in a transporter room in spacedock uhura is present when kirk sulu and mccoy arrive she blackmails the officer she works with in the facility and beams her three friends aboard the enterprise on board already is scotty who has reworked the ships control systems to be operated from the bridge as they prep the ship for departure they are hailed by federation security to return the enterprise a warning that kirk orders ignored the ship moves out heading directly for the docks space doors which remain closed scotty following several attempts is successful in opening them allowing the enterprise to escape meanwhile on board excelsior captain styles receives orders to pursue and stop kirk the enterprise goes to warp speed and streaks away excelsior powers up styles planning to use the ships experimental transwarp drive to overtake the enterprise when he orders the transwarp drive activated it fails leaving excelsior stranded outside spacedock on board the enterprise scotty gives a handful of circuits to mccoy admitting hed sabotaged the other shipon genesis saavik confronts david about the unstable nature of the planet david admits that he used a volatile substance protomatter in the genesis project matrix the protomatter may have advanced davids research but has created a planet that is aging too rapidly to be habitable the same effect is also advancing spocks development and david and saavik conclude that they must escape the planet before it destroys itself and to halt spocks rapid aging spock is also experiencing a biological process called pon farr transformational periods that occur every seven year in which a vulcan male develops into an adult saavik is able to soothe the painful process for spocklater the three are captured by kruge and is crew kruge tells them of his intention to seize the genesis research despite davids insistence that it doesnt work kruge of course intends to use it as a weapon the renegade commander is called back to his ship when the enterprise arrives at genesis kruge orders the cloaking device engaged and they wait for enterprise to close the distance for attack on board the enterprise chekov loses a signal on his sensor as the birdofprey cloaks the crew looks closely at the viewscreen and kirk notices a shimmering distortion as kruge orders his ship decloaked and prepares to fire sulu identifies it and kirk orders the firing of photon torpedoes the birdofprey is hit directly and begins to tumble but quickly recovers having suffered minimal damage kirk orders the enterprises shields to be raised but scotty reports that the ships systems are malfunctioning due to the unexpected battle and before the crew can do anything else the klingons fire a torpedo at the ships warp engines causing devastating damage which destroys the enterprises main systems leaving the ship a lifeless hulkkirk hails the klingon ship and demands to know why they are there and why they attacked kruge realizes that he has the advantage since kirk would have just destroyed the birdofprey if the enterprise was capable and demands that kirk surrender saying that the very possession of genesis by the federation brands them as warlike he also reveals that he is holding saavik david and spock prisoner he allows communication with them and saavik tells kirk that spock is with them david tells kirk that the planet will selfdestruct and that spock must be taken off immediately kruge to show his intentions are sincere orders one of his prisoners executed one of the klingons draws a dagger and prepares to kill saavik david intervenes and fights with the klingon who stabs david to death kirk is overwhelmed by the death of his son after a few moments he invites kruge to send over some of his crew to retrieve them and the genesis materials he orders mccoy and sulu to the transporter room leaving himself chekov and scotty on the bridge the three activate the enterprises selfdestruct sequence and leave for the transporters they beam down to the planet just as kruges men arrive they find the bridge and discover the timer counting down kruges order to beam them back comes too late and the enterprise explodes on the planet kirk and his friends watch as the enterprise falls out of orbit and burns up in the genesis atmosphere kirk asks my god bones what have i done mccoy replies what you always do turn death into a fighting chance at lifekirk and his team find saavik and spock just as spock in a rage of pain throws one of his klingon captors possibly killing him kirk kills the second guard saavik tells kirk that the genesis effect will kill spock if they dont leave the planet immediately just then kruge beams down and holds them all at gunpoint he orders his crew to beam up everyone but kirk and spock kruge demands genesis kirk says hell give it to him if he beams spock up which kruge refuses the two fight handtohand while the ground shifts and rumbles with earthquakes around them they battle to the edge of a cliff part of which falls away under kruges feet leaving him dangling over a chasm of molten rock kirk offers to pull the klingon up when he does kruge tries to pull kirk down with him kirk kicks kruge several times in the face finally dislodging him kruge falls hundreds of feet and burns up in the extreme temperatures below kirk runs back to spock grabs kruges communicator and imitating the klingons voice calls for beamup he and spock arrive safely on the birdofprey which has been commandeered by kirks comrades the speed off as genesis explodesthe ship arrives on vulcan where sarek has made preparations at mount seleya spocks body is brought up to an altar on the mountain where the high priestess tlar awaits with sarek sarek asks for the ancient ritual of faltorpan the refusion of spocks katra with his body tlar warns that the ritual has succeeded only in legend she also warns mccoy that the ritual carries as much danger for him as it does spock mccoy agrees to participatean indeterminate amount of time passes while tlar performs the ceremony the enterprises crew waits anxiously until mccoy walks down from the altar apparently fine kirk asks sarek if the ritual was successful to which sarek replies only time will tell spock clad in a white robe descends at first oblivious to kirks and his old friends presence however he stops and recognizes kirk he asks ship out of danger to which kirk says that he saved them all spock a note of recognition in his face says jim your name is jim kirk and his friends are overjoyed 6.6klingon planet vulcan admiral
