wolfes book on the history of the us space program reads like a novel and the film has that same fictional quality it covers the breaking of the sound barrier by chuck yeager to the mercury 7 astronauts showing that no one had a clue how to run a space program or how to select people to be in it thrilling funny charming and electrifying all at once the first seven mercury astronauts we go behind the prepackaged unblemished saints we knew through the media to find imperfect human beings who were actually even more heroic the astronauts are heroes no doubt about it as space pioneer chuck yaeger bitterly points out these men all knew the risks they were taking as they rode their primitive capsules into space they knew they were powered by rockets that could explode them into the tiniest of atoms there were the fierce fires of reentry that could reduce them to cinders as well as the possibility of no reentry leaving them to perish miserably in their orbits yet these men eagerly took those risks they were made of the right stuff the story of the beginnings of the us space program and the first seven mercury astronauts the space began when chuck yeager broke the sound barrier it was after the soviets successfully launched the sputnik satellite in 1959 that the us redoubled its efforts to catch up after rigorous testing 7 pilots were selected for the program they instantly became the modern day equivalent of rock stars appearing on television and having articles written about them in life magazine the work was serious however and dangerous given the poor record the missile designers faced with multiple failures before finally getting a successful launch there is a good deal of rivalry among the usas first astronauts some quite serious as ambitions and different values come into play in 1947 a group of determined men gathered at a remote air force base in the high desert of california their goal was to break the sound barrier by using a small rocketpowered test plane called the x1 the only problem was that others had tried before and not all had survived some thought of the sound barrier as a demon that lived in the sky waiting to destroy any who dared confront itchuck yeager sam shepard a young wartime ace with a wild reputation volunteers to fly the x1 and spends the night before his flight at the local bar after a few drinks he and his wife go galloping off on their horses through the twilight but a tree branch catches yeager across the chest knocking him off the horse and cracking a few ribs hiding his injury from the flight crew the next morning yeager climbs painfully into the plane and prepares to confront the sound barrier demonthe little x1 is carried aloft by a large b29 bomber then at the right altitude is dropped free yeager ignites the rocket engine and quickly zooms up into the sky going faster and faster closing in on the deadly mach1 mark the plane begins to vibrate then shake with yeager fighting the controls suddenly there is a strange boom heard by the crew waiting on the ground and everyone fears that the sound barrier has claimed another life a moment later they are surprised to hear yeagers calm voice crackle over the radio make a note here would you this machmeter must be busted its jumped clear off the scale amazed then jubilant they realize that yeager has done it the sound barrier had been broken a reporter rushes to the nearest pay phone to report the event and is stopped by an air force officer who tells him the nature of the mission is top secret  they dont want the news to reach the soviet unionthe desert airbase now called edwards quickly becomes the center for all test and experimental aircraft in the us and every hotshot jetjockey looking for a chance to become famous gravitates there a few years pass and one such pilot gordo cooper dennis quaid cant wait to take a crack at becoming the best pilot anyone ever saw he finds edwards already packed with others like himself with yeager still at the top of the pyramidunforeseen events halfway around the world change everything for these test pilots the communists launch sputnik historys first orbiting satellite and suddenly everything is focused on the race for space looking for the first american astronauts representatives from the newly formed nasa visit edwards cooper sees a chance to stand out from the crowd and volunteers along with his friends gus grissom fred ward and deke slayton scott paulin other pilots such as alan shepard scott glenn from the navy and john glenn ed harris a marine flyer also answer the calltested to exhaustion the astronaut candidates are slowly weeded out leaving a mere seven pilots as the handpicked group that will lead america into space basking in their glory they are stunned to hear that the soviets have beaten them again launching the first human yuri gagarin into space chagrined they must now play catchup with the russians and alan shepard is chosen to be the first american astronautstrapped into his capsule early on the morning of the launch he waits patiently while ground control works its way through an endless series of glitches shepards flight was supposed to be a short 15minute loft into space and hes been waiting on the pad for hours feeling the call of nature shepard is forced to do it in the suit much to the embarrassment of ground control however once hes relieved himself he demands that they get on with it and fire the rocket im cooler than you are so lets light this candle everyone holds their breath and the button is pushed shepards rocket ignites and quickly climbs into the sky subjected to tremendous stress during the launch and then the fall back to earth he survives the flight and is picked up by the waiting helicopter america has its first astronautgus grissom is next and his flight goes well but during the recovery the hatch on his capsule is unexpectedly blown off and when the sea floods in grissom nearly drowns no one believes his claim that there was a fault in the system and hes denied the heros welcome afforded shepard the russians make yet another bold move placing a second man into orbit while the americans struggle with short suborbital flights decisive action is needed and john glenn is chosen for the next american missionan unreliable rocket is chosen to launch glenn into orbit and the country watches as the risky flight progresses thankfully glenns capsule makes it into orbit and everyone draws a sigh of relief soon however trouble develops and there is a serious doubt that the capsules heat shield will protect glenn during reentry without it hell be incinerated facing the fact that theres nothing he can do but try glenn fires his retros and begins to fall back through the atmosphere at 18000 miles per hour as the heat builds up around the capsule his radio link to the ground is blanked out and all they can do is wait minutes tick by as glenn tears through the superheated air amazingly he survives and american can finally claim they have at last matched the russians in the space raceback at edwards events have bypassed chuck yeager no one cares about highaltitude flight or machspeed records now everyone is talking about spacemen in one more recordsetting attempt yeager takes a specially modified f104 starfighter up in a dangerous highaltitude flight zooming through the stratosphere once more he pushes his plane to the limit climbing higher and higher pushed to a record altitude by the rocket in the tail the sky around him grows dark as he approaches the edge of spacesuddenly the engine begins to stall the air is too thin and the jet cant keep running at this height the plane slows as alarm lights flash on the control panel yeager looks out at the dark sky around him and for a moment he can see the stars twinkling just out of reach he is almost there but the plane lurches and begins to fall theres no control no power no way to recover yeager is in a deadly flat spin spiraling down faster and faster yeager struggles to get his craft under control but as he nears the ground he must either eject or crash pulling the ejection control his seat is fired out of the doomed plane but the small rocket in the ejection seat has ignited his flight suit and he plummets through the clouds trailing smoke as the flames burn up into his helmeton the ground the crash truck lumbers out over the flat desert toward the crashed plane the recovery crew fully expects to find yeagers smashed body in the wreckage but something off in the distance catches their eye and they turn toward it as they draw closer the shape becomes yeager his face badly burned calmly walking towards them he has survived once againintercut with yeagers flight are scenes of the mercury astronauts attending a huge texas banquet thrown by lyndon b johnson the men watch a performance by fan dancer sally rand and look at each other knowing theyre heroes to all americans gordo cooper remarks that hes achieved success as an astronaut having a good home money and a fine meal and that he hasnt even been on a space mission yet when asked who the greatest pilot he ever knew was gordo hesitates for a time perhaps wanting to mention chuck yeager and instead answers youre lookin at himas the last of the mercury7 astronauts prepares for his flight into space the ground controllers hear snoring over the microphone in the capsule gordo cooper is finally getting his chance to prove he has the right stuff but first they have to wake him up laughing they continue the countdown and cooper rides the rocket into space setting records for the longest space flight to date and proving if only for a short time that he is the greatest pilot anyone ever saw the narrator tells us that cooper was the last astronaut to go into space alone 7.9astronaut space-program fire u.s.-space-program rocket sound-barrier rivalry marine
