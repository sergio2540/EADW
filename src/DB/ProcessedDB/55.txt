door guard he approaches léons apartment wondering whether the girl who was accepted there was the missing girl léon prepares himself to shoot him watching through a hidden peephole but at that moment mathilda turns on the tv with some  transformers  cartoons which convinces the guard that he saw another girl who had nothing to do with the situationleón offers some consolation to mathilda making her smile when he argues than pigs smell well and are better than many people and makepretends that the puppet pig hes using is talking to her mathilda who soon discovers that léon is a hitman begs

léon refuses point blank being a cleaner is not a job for girls and then he alleges that shes not made for that to answer to that mathilda shoots some pigeons with one of the guns léon is cleaning léon hesitantly accepts her offer and the two begin working together slowly building an emotional attachment with léon becoming a friend and father figurethey leave léons apartment and léon begins to settle some rules mathilda carries leóns plant accepting everything and convinces the receptionist george martin that shes preparing for an audition and that she wont practice after 10 when the receptionist asks léon to fill up the registration form mathilda jumps right in and says you know how much i love registering can i do it daddy léon breaths and apprecciates that mathilda is resourceful the receptionist congratulates léon because hes got a good daughter but hes got a 17yearold who cant do anything león leaves his plant at reception he checks everything in the room the exits the windows while mathilda fills up the form as they work together mathilda admits to léon several times that she is falling in love with him in spite of him making her drink a glass of milk every daytony has been keeping léon money instead of being put into a bank as léon was illiterate he didnt want to have to deal with it léon asks if he could give it to somebody tony tells him that hes like a bank only that theres not paperwork involved but that hes got all the accountancy in his wind tony wants léon to renew work as training wont earn him any money léon prevents mathilda from flirting with a guy michael mundra a little older than herself she replies that they were only sharing a cigarette  to which léon answer that he wants her to quit smoking léon adds that she should stay away from him as he looks like a weirdo léon goes to work on his own on foot mathilda says that shes fed up of practicing to the receptionist mathilda tells him that léon is not her father but her lover and that shes going for walk mathilda goes back to her old flat and picks up a teddy bear and a pad of money hidden under a loose wooden plank she has to hide because the fbi is questioning stan who is being a jackass about the people he killed in the line of duty he shouts to the fbi guy that kids should be at school and also shouts his office numbermathilday follows stan by taxi telling the driver abdul hassan sharif to shut the fuck up and drive she follows him to the police station mathilda is watching  transformers  again when léon arrives with blood in an arm and a pink dress for her the receptionist arrives with two men throwing both of them out in another hotel room léon has a shower and stitches himself in the chest where hes been hurt mathilda wants to pay léon to kill his brothers killers but léon doesnt want to he tells that life changes after the first time you kill somebody she wants to play the russian roulette with him she threatens him with killing

dea building in an attempt to kill him only to be ambushed by stansfield in a bathroom léon discovering her intentions after reading a note left for him by mathilda rushes to the building and rescues her shooting two of stansfields men in the processstansfield is enraged that what he calls the italian hitman has gone rogue and is killing his men he confronts tony and threatens him eventually beating him into surrendering léons whereabouts later as mathilda returns home from grocery shopping an nypd esu team sent by stansfield takes her hostage and attempts to infiltrate léons apartment léon ambushes the esu team and takes one of their members hostage rapidly bartering him for mathildas freedom as they slink back into the apartment léon creates a quick escape for matilda as he reassures her and tells her that he loves her moments before they come for himin the chaos that follows léon sneaks out of the apartment building disguised as a wounded esu officer almost unnoticed save for stansfield who recognizes him and silently sneaks up and shoots him from behind looming over the dying léon stansfield jeers him haughtily however just before he gives out léon places an object in stansfields hands which he explains is from mathilda opening his hands stansfield recognizes it as the pin from a grenade and rips open léons vest to discover several grenades on his chest stansfield lets out a brief and final quip oh shit right before a massive explosion devastates them bothmathilda heads to tonys place as she was instructed to do by léon tony will not give mathilda more than a few dollars of the fortune léon had amassed which was being held by tony his reasoning is that she is not old enough to receive the large amount of money and that school should be her priority until shes older when mathilda asks tony to give her a job and insists that she can clean as léon had tony sternly informs her that he aint got no work for a 12yearold kid having nowhere else to go she is then seen going to roosevelt island using the roosevelt island tramway the next day she returns to school in nj seemingly readmitted to the school mathilda walks into a field in front of
