this over when he graduated and george would go on a european tour and then go to college but his father has a fatal stroke and george has to take over the bl for a few months giving up the european tour then potter attempts to liquidate the bl the only thing that can stop it is for george himself to take it over so he gives up college and gives his college money to harry the plan at that point was that after harry graduates he will take over the bl and george will go to college but harry returns from college having married ruth dakin and ruths father has offered him a job in upstate new

gower spent 20 years in prison for poisoning some child and that if this stranger knows mr gower he must be a convict also nick has george and clarence thrown out of the tavern and then derisively
