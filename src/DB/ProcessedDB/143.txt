lives  including the captains eventually he and maria find themselves falling in love even though georg is already engaged to a baroness and maria is still a postulant the romance makes them both start questioning the decisions they have made their personal conflicts soon become overshadowed however by world events austria is about to come under the control of germany and the captain may soon find himself drafted into the german navy and forced to fight against his own country maria had longed to be a nun since she was a young girl yet when she became old enough discovered that it wasnt at

want the baron back in military service maria is a failure as a nun the mother superior sends her off in answer to a letter from a retired naval captain for a governess for his seven children she goes to their house and finds that she is the latest in a long line of governesses run off by the children she teaches the children to sing and that becomes their bonding force of course leading her to fall in love with their father and marries him as this is happening austria votes to be assumed by germany on the eve of world war ii captain baron von trapp is a widowed exnaval officer with seven children who serve only to remind him of his deceased wife the von trapp home is thus turned into a gloomy place of order and discipline until the arrival of a new governess frauline marie who is from a nearby salzburg abbey marie shows the von trapp children the miracle of the sound of music and teaches them how to sing captain von trapps heart opens up to feelings he had forgotten and he and marie fall in love marie and georg von trapp are married only to have their world brought down around them by the 1938 anschluss of austria where nazi germany takes control of the country and demands that captain von trapp assume a position in the german navy the widowed retired austrian naval officer captain von trapp christopher plummer has made his austrian home one of overly restrictive and harshly enforced discipline one that most unintentionally causes his seven children to be underfed when it comes to joy and love being a nun living in a convent is similarly restrictive and unfulfilling for maria julie andrews who breaks rules to try to change it the reverend mother peggy wood decides that maria who is not cutting it as a nun should leave and take on a job as governess at the nearby von trapp household in salzburgthrough music and various outings maria gives the children a taste of a more fulfilling joyous life than they have ever known and they come to love her

her that she must face rather than run from the situation causing maria to return to the captains home it seems though that she is too late learning that the captain and the baroness have become engagedthe captain who had surely concluded that he could never have maria for a wife confides to the baroness that he loves maria but the baroness admits she had sensed it long ago and the engagement is called off the captain and maria marry but an ugly situation befronts them upon return from their honeymoon  the captain has been summoned in a telegram by the third reich to serve in its navydue
