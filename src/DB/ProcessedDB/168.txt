with him at camelot he finds many knights including sir galahad the pure sir lancelot the brave the quiet sir bedevere and sir robin the notquitesobraveassir lancelot they do not travel on horses but pretend they do and have their servants bang coconuts to make the sound of horses hooves through satire of certain events in history witch trials the black plague they find camelot but after literally a quick song and dance they decide that they do not want to go there while walking away god who seems to be grumpy come to them from a cloud and tells them to find the holy grail they agree and begin their search while they search for the grail scenes of the knights tales appear and why they have the name they have throughout their search they meet interesting people and knights along the way most of the characters die some through a killer rabbit which they defeat with the holy hand grenade others from not answering a question right from the bridge of death or die some other ridiculous way in the end king arthur and sir bedevere are left and find the castle arrrghhh where the holy grail is they are met by some french soldiers who taunted them earlier in the film so they were not able to get into the castle the credits are rolled to deeply ominous music with several false starts interlaced with apologies for the inadequacies of each during which numerous titlers are fired en masse in the end credits that are heavily laced with references to moose and llamas are rolled to highly festive latin musiclittle is to be seen but fog over a grassland while the sound of a galloping horse  a sound that could only be made on cobblestone but not grass  is heard from the fog emerges two pedestrians one king arthur graham chapman dressed in chain mail a tunic and a crown the other patsy terry gilliam appears to be fulfilling the role of a beast of burden and is using two halfcoconuts percussivelythey approach a castle and patsy perfectly mimics the sound of a galloping horse coming to a stop two guards become barely visible atop the castle wall arthur announces that he is looking for knights to join him at camelot and wishes to recruit the master of the castle unfortunately the two guards are immediately distracted by patsys halfcoconuts arthur tries to return the conversation to the quest but the guards are unable to turn their attentions from the possible causes for coconuts appearing in england or how a bird or a set of birds might have brought one up from the tropics frustrated arthur and patsy emulate riding offthe scene changes to a plague village a cart is being drawn through the streets and is attended by a disheveled man eric idle who strikes a triangle and calls for the residents to bring out your dead a peasant john cleese tries to lay a decrepit man on the cart without calling attention to the fact that he is still alive the attendant refuses to accept living cargo citing regulations when the peasant tries to abstractly request a favour the attendant looks up and down the street to make sure there are no witnesses and strikes the subject a deadly blow to the head solving the problem they then continue on their ways arthur and patsy emulate a ride through the village and the attendant correctly infers that arthur is a king from the fact that he is not covered in shiton a hillside near a castle arthur approaches a peasant michael palin from behind and calls out old woman the peasant dennis barely turns his head to correct the king with man rather than killing this vulgar subject on the spot for such gross insubordination arthur tries to apologize for the mistake unimpressed dennis then launches into a rant making it very clear that he has harboured a great deal of bitterness over the class system under which he has been at the bottom all his life of 37 years arthur is challenged to justify his kingship and to an accompaniment of heavenly voices tells the tale of the lady of the lake presenting arthur with excalibur dennis then confidently challenges this presumption of political legitimacy focusing on the executive branch he asserts that it must derive from a mandate from the masses arthur can only respond by barking orders that the peasant be silent unaffected dennis continues his elocution of democratic dogma at which point arthur manhandles him this only encourages dennis more and he becomes a raving firebrand and tries to call as much attention as possible to arthurs assault the king accepts that he cannot adequate assert this authority in this situation and relinquishes dennis with bloody peasant dennis despite his anger appears delighted at this parting shot and its significance to his message he seeks validation from the gathering crowdwhile travelling through a forest arthur and patsy encounter an epic battle between two armoured faceless men the weapons swords an anointed mace and an axe when the blackclad knight john cleese runs his opponent through the face he retrieves his sword and then simply stands tall arthur approaches him and praises him for his performance the knight neither speaks a word nor does he even turn his gaze towards the king despite this insolence arthur again does not respond with homicide but invites the knight to enter his court when no response is given arthur announces that he will continue on his quest the knight then speaks with a deep voice and economy of words forbidding arthur to cross the bridge before which he is standing this bridge would allow the party to cross a gully no more than 10 feet wide arthur and the knight draw their swords and a much less epic battle ensues when arthur severs one of the knights arms he is unwilling to accept defeat arthur manages to relieve the knight of his other arm and kneels down to offer a prayer of thanks the knight kicks him over the now completely unarmed knight drops his ominous mystique and childishly goads arthur into chopping off his remaining limbs no longer able to physically obstruct arthur they ride off all the while ignoring the knights continued challengesa group of monks are chanting latin while hitting themselves with wooden boards as they traverse a village which looks much like the plague village a frenzied mob drags a witch connie booth to bedevere terry jones who is performing an experiment involving a coconut tied to a bird they present their case based on the way she is dressed the funnel on her head and the parsnip tied over her nose they also present testimony from a peasant john cleese who had been turned into a newt or so he claims bedevere proceeds to deduce the validity of their charge in his own way using a scientific method befitting the dark ages of europe he deduces a formula for determining the accuseds witchhood based on the flammability and buoyancy of various objects and materials the crowd has become very quiet and still probably because bedevere is overtaxing their intelligence leaving no excess energy for mindless shouting or jumping about it is eventually reasoned that the weight of the accused compared to that of a ducks determines her witchhood remembering their original purpose they return to their frenzy and carry her off to be weighed arthur approaches bedevere when arthur identifies himself bedevere bows to the king and is then knightedcamelot has its first knightwe are hurried through the recruitment of the remaining knights by the book of the film they are sir lancelot the brave john cleese sir galahad the pure michael palin also called the chaste sir robin thenotquitesobraveassirlancelot eric idle and the aptly named sir notappearinginthisfilm a baby william palin suited up in chain mailthe party emulates riding to camelot and when spying it from a distance they stop to appreciate its majesty we are then treated to a song and dance routine performed by the knights presumably within the castle walls this includes an interlude with tapdancing and a percussion solo even the decrepit shell of a man mark zycon suspended by his wrists in the dungeon below manages to pathetically cheer the upbeat celebrations upstairs we are then returned to the outside of camelot at the same distance from the castle arthur seems to have had the same perception we have just had since he elects to avoid camelot calling it a silly placewhile riding to some unknown destination a lowbudget animation of the almighty appears in the sky he is not willing to suffer fools gladly and when done chastising arthur for his obsequiousness charges arthur with seeking the holy grail thus the quest for the holy grail begins as manifested by another animation sequence with images reminiscent of medieval artour heroes encounter a castle with a french taunter john cleese who taunts them with random names like daffy english knights unaware that knight has silent letters and only one n and makes up flowery insults such as i fart in your general direction and your mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries whether or not this man is french is unclear since his frenchtalking colleagues appear to understand english words more readily than french ones and his accent slips when shouting im french arthur gives the same terms to the inhabitants of the castle as he did with the first one he approached including of course the part involving the grail the frenchman claims that they already have a grail but then indicates to his peers that this is a mischievous fabrication halfstunned arthur asks to see it the guard rejects the request with his typical inane derision arthur then takes a more aggressive posture and in midthreat the french launch a cow from what sounds like a catapult at arthurs party landing on one of them with all possible gusto arthur orders a charge and they all attack the castle walls several feet high with nothing more effective than swords arthurs party is then treated to a barrage of livestock arthur then orders a retreat but since he does not know the meaning of the word he uses a different expression sir bedeveres keen mind then hatches a plan a giant hare made of wood known as a trojan rabbit is wheeled towards the castle the french understand that it is intended as a present for them and then cautiously bring it into the castle sir bedevere then explains the remainder of his plans but at this point he realizes that he forgot the step where the knights are supposed to climb into the rabbit before it is to be presented to the enemy using the same technology as before the wooden colossus is sent over the castle walls killing one of the servants neil innesa clapboard is snapped in front of a famous historian john young who narrates some unseen details of arthurs experience with the french and then informs us that the king decided that he and his knights should search for the grail individually anything else he was going to tell us is cut short when an unidentified knight on horseback slashes his neckafter they split up sir robin travels through a forest with his favourite minstrels the vocal one sings of robins bravery and describes in graphic detail the various ordeals that robin is prepared to face just as the vocal minstrel is about to sing of the gory treatment robins penis could withstand robin gracefully orders them silent they immediately encounter a threeheaded giant the giant interrogates robin who wishes to discreetly downplay his significance but his minstrel sings of robins identity and credentials one of the heads wishes to cut robins head off but they immediately descend into bickering about each others lifestyles and various things completely unrelated to robin when they finally agree on the next course of action they will take they see that robin is no longer available sir robin has in fact continued on the quest and his minstrel sings a song that absurdly describes his lords brave cowardice over robins objectionsgalahad wet weary and probably depleted of much of his shortterm vitality follows a grailshaped light to castle anthrax there he finds a colony of robeclad teens who will not hear of any talk about a grail but insist on tending to what they perceive to be galahads immediate needsthey decide that they are medical galahad is shy and finds the strength to resist temptation and again demands to see the grail at this point a girl named dingo carol cleveland realizes that one of their rules has been broken for which galahad must administer the punishment dingo describes the punishment which expands to include more and more inhabitants of the castle and becomes increasingly sexual galahad finally seems willing to accept their hospitality but then his friends storm the castle and rescue him as he is being rescued he insists on remaining to fight the perils alone but they valiantly stand by him thinking only of his safety the heroes leave a castle full of very frustrated girlswe then reach the famous scene 24 arthur and sir bedevere are in a hut trying to extract information about the grail from a frighteningly withered old man terry gilliam who can only cackle insanely to arthurs questions a fire burns in the middle of the room eventually the miscreation speaks but does not answer arthurs questions directly he does speak of an enchanter and the bridge of death the old man disappears as does the hut along with any indication of civilization save the firearthurs party are progressing through a foggy forest stressful music plays while arthur makes strenuous glances to the left and the right the stress is brought to its natural end when they find themselves before a knight michael palin approximately twice the height of arthur he is surrounded by several other armoured men who lumber about like animals they are the knights who say ni they do indeed say ni as a form of intimidation and coercion and liberally use it on arthur at the slightest provocation and also dread using the word it they demand a shrubbery from arthur on pain of deathmodernday police officers conduct an investigation of the murder of the famous historian and interview a woman rita davies who was close to himthe king of swamp castle michael palin has a yorkshire accent and brags about how he managed to build a castle on the worst possible terrain he could find and brashly admits that the first few attempts were complete failures he then explains to his son prince herbert terry jones that the acquisition of more land is essential to their kingdom which is why he must marry a princess who is connected to a great deal of it herbert has a horribly pale complexion and is insufferably effeminateso much so that his own father mistakes him for aliceherbert is reluctant to participate in this landgrab and wishes to express himself in song but the king shouts down the erupting music and forbids herbert to sing the king impatiently closes the discussion and storms off as he prepares to leave the room he orders two guards to watch herbert unfortunately the guard with speaking parts eric idle has a very hard time processing the phrase stay here and make sure he doesnt leave when his father finally leaves melancholy music erupts and the king returns to repeat his prohibition on singing herbert then tries to inconspicuously write a note tie it to an arrow and shoot it through a window to the outside the guards see what he is doing but appear oblivious to the ramifications sir lancelot discovers the note when the arrow it is tied to buries itself in the chest of his servant concorde eric idle the message is from someone pleading to be rescued from a forced marriage he then enthusiastically assumes that this is part of his quest for the grail and resolves to rescue what he thinks is a maidenhe charges into the castle and attacks several members of a wedding party including the father of the bride and as many unarmed guards as he can when he takes too many seconds between killing people he attacks a wallhanging he bursts into herberts room and then kills the guards while one of them tries to recall the instructions his king gave him and how they might relate to the newcomer the king then appears and expresses his displeasure at the disruption that lancelot has caused however when he learns that lancelot is from camelot he appears to believe that lancelot can provide some unspecified gain in lieu of herbertafter severing the linens that herbert is currently using to make his escape down the castle walls he escorts lancelot out of the room while making friendly conversation the king tries to introduce lancelot to the crowd but their predictable hostility excites lancelot into combat once again and he kills a few more people before the king can calm him down again the king then proceeds to explain the new arrangement involving the princess and her holdings which somehow depends on the death of her father when her father appears to be recovering from lancelots attack he motions to one of his guards who approaches the father of the bride the king then gives a narrative of the princesss father succumbing to his wounds and surely enough he dies herbert then appears in the castle apparently in good health which irritates his father his irritation escalates when herbert begins to explain his ordeal in song concorde then appears and suggests that lancelot return to the quest lancelot insists on a melodramatically exit and then swings across the room from a rope somehow the stunt fails and he is left dangling above the centre of the roomwhile riding into yet another provincial village arthur meets the old crone bee duffell she is asked about a shrubbery but appears terrified by the inquiry and refuses to cooperate with some reluctance about the optics of such a spectacle arthur and bedevere coerce her with the word ni fortunately roger the shrubber eric idle boldly happens by and both parties are satisfiedarthur and bedevere return to the dreaded knights who say ni but find that their name has been changed to something so complex and random it was probably ad libbed and therefore cannot be repeated here the knights who so recently said ni then charge arthur with another useless errand and an impossible task the eccentric knights are defeated by arthurs accidental discovery of a secret word which is their weakness robin and his musically sardonic minstrels then appear on the scene they ride off togetherthe police continue their murder investigationthe adventurers each overcome their individual perils and reunite to face a bleak and terrible winter which they survive by eating sir robins minstrelsthe reunited party ventures further to find the enchanter named tim john cleese tim the enchanter appears as a scotstalking middleaged man but commands great powers of pyrokinesis has a very long greystreaked beard and on his head either wears rams horns or grows them there he is also able to withstand long awkward silences doing nothing to break them arthur and his party are in awe of tim and his spectacular display of pyrotechnics and find themselves flustered when asking him for help as per the instructions of the old man from scene 24 tim promises to help with their next phase of intelligence gathering and beckons the party follow him after one step he abruptly turns around and speaks of a terrible monster the longer he spends on the warning the more foolish he appears arthurs fearful respect for the enchanter is diminishingthe company approaches a rockencircled clearing beyond which is the mouth of a cave that breathes smoke skeletons litter the scene the tension jumps when tim sights the monster when the knights realize that the monster is an averagelooking rabbit the tension immediate turns to annoyance and scorn sir bors terry gilliam having been ordered to dispatch the creature sets forth to perform the task as casually as a shortorder cook would perform his craft the rabbit leaps about six feet to bite off sir borss head before the knight even raises his sword tim feels vindicated and expresses it as would an 11yearold arthur believing a full scale attack is sufficient to accomplish the task orders one when several knights die in the attempt he orders a retreat in his own unique way tim regards the carnage with scorn of his ownwild chortling when someone recalls the holy hand grenade of antioch arthur calls to brother maynard eric idle who is seen with his entourage a stonesthrow away but offcamera until this scene they consult with his orders exhaustive canon on use of the weapon the book of arnaments verses 921 describing how to use the grenade and saint attila raised the hand grenade up on high saying o lord bless this thy hand grenade that with it thou mayst blow thine enemies to tiny bits in thy mercy and the lord did grin and the people did feast upon the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies and orangutans and breakfast cereals and fruitbats and large chucleric is told to skip forward by brother maynardand the lord spake saying first shalt thou take out the holy pin then shalt thou count to three no more no less three shall be the number thou shalt count and the number of the counting shall be three four shalt thou not count neither count thou two excepting that thou then proceed to three five is right out once the number three being the third number be reached then lobbest thou thy holy hand grenade of antioch towards thy foe who being naughty in my sight shall snuff it after a miscount the grenade is thrown at the rabbit and a thundering explosion alerts the police who are already looking for a murdererin the cave beyond the rabbit aramaic writing is found which brother maynard translates finally they receive concrete instructions on where to find the grail the castle of aaaaarrrrrrggghhh while they are trying to deduce the meaning of the text the knights are suddenly ambushed by the legendary animated black beast of aaaaarrrrrrggghhh the human party also animated are chased about the cave and are only saved when the animator terry gilliam suffers a fatal heart attackthe police discover the gruesome scene at the cave entrance that they might assume is a homicide and not an animal attackthey approach the bridge of death that is guarded by the old man from scene 24 arthur orders sir robin to face the deadly quiz that the old man will give him who finds a way to steer the course of action towards other knights trying first lancelot makes the first attempt and when the party sees that the challenge is as difficult as answering a few superficial personal questions robin finds his bravery renewed and volunteers to be the next participant unfortunately the last question asked robin involves geographical trivia that would have been very rare knowledge in the dark ages and is thrown into the pit of death galahad then flubs his answer and is also lost when arthur is asked a question about aerodynamics involving the redundant airspeed velocity he solves the problem by answering it with a specific question which the bridgekeeper cannot answer the old man is then cast into the pit and the way is cleararthur and bedevere search for lancelot but he is not to be found in fact he has his hands pressed against a police car and is being searched the king and his remaining free knight are then called by an ethereal song they are drawn over misty mountains to a lake they are then presented with a barge with the head of a monster on the bow to a majestic brassrich soundtrack the boat transports our heroes across the water to an island where found is the castle aaarrghhas the music reaches crescendo the men disembark and kneel arthur mounting his sword tip on the ground offers the lord a solemn prayer the music is interrupted by the sound of a catapult being discharged arthurs speech switches from prayer to blasphemy as a sheep lands on them the taunting frenchman then appears atop the castle wall and performs his insolent craft arthur launches into orders threats and expressions of indignation invoking gods name the french respond with human waste humiliated and soiled the pair walk back through the water to the mainland as the french taunt at willreaching the other side of the lake arthur shouts to an unseen party to stand ready to the sound of a military drum emerging on a nearby ridge soldiers numbering maybe 1000 form a line of battle nearly as many feet in width they are well equipped arthur shouts a deadly oath across the lake to the french who persist in their taunts without hesitation arthur orders a charge and the company surges forwardas the soldiers approach the shore on the mainland they are cut off by a mere two police cars arriving on the scene the line of battle has shrunk to less than 100 feet and arthur and bedevere are arrested at least three of the officers start pushing back the crowd and confiscate an offensive weapon the movie camera is grabbed and the film appears to have run out of the projector we see nothing but black the movie tries to appease the audience with popular organ music 8.4knight
