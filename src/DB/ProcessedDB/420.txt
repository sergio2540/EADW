chamberlike hall but he escapes through a tiny door the doorknob joseph kearns suggests alice drink from a bottle marked drink me the contents shrink her to a tiny fraction of her original size the door is locked and the key appears on the table which she can not reach the doorknob directs her to a cookie marked eat me the cookie makes her grow so large that her head hits the ceiling she begins

of talking flowers who originally appeared in chapter 3 of through the lookingglassalice chases after the rabbit again and in another example of a vignette borrowed from through the lookingglass she

she engages a hookahsmoking caterpillar who turns into a butterfly though not before giving her cryptic advice about the mushroom she is sitting on alice breaks off two pieces and nibbles them alternately first growing very large and unintentionally aggravating a nesting mother bird queenie leonard who accuses alice of being a serpent then shrinking very small finally alice manages to restore herself to her normal size and stores the pieces in her apron pocketsalice receives mysterious directions from the cheshire cat sterling holloway an eerily grinning feline that can disappear
