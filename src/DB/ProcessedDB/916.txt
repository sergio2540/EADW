be uninhabitable after the irreversible effects of pollution and global warming professor john robinson lead scientist of the jupiter 2 mission will lead his family to the habitable planet alpha prime to prep it for colonization the jupiter 2 is equipped with a hyperdrive that allows fasterthanlight travel which will eventually be employed to evacuate the citizens of earth however hypergates must be constructed on earth and alpha prime to provide stable points of departure and arrival dr zachary smith is bribed by a terrorist organization to sabotage the mission and ends up an unwilling stowaway as the ship blasts off in the near future earths fossil resources are about to be used up in an attempt to save the human race scientists have begun building a gate through which faster than light travel will be possible  but only if there is a gate at the destination to receive the travelers the robinson family has been chosen to travel to alpha prime  the only other inhabitable planet known  at normal speed ten years cryogenically frozen but dr smith a sinister man sabotages their spaceship jupiter 2 but is also betrayed by his people so he has to work together with the robinsons in order to survive himself when jupiter 2 is falling into the sun the only chance to survive is to activate the hyperdrive  without a gate at the other end soon the robinsons are someplace really unknown where they meet unfriendly siliconbased space spiders take in a little apelike creature and name new star systems after bugs bunny and porky pig they have to reach alpha prime in order to build the second gate or earths only hope is gone with the earth running short of natural energy resources the jupiter mission to colonize and exploit alpha prime seems to be the only chance of survival professor john robinson william hurt  together with his wife maureen his family and fighter pilot don west lead a desperate attempt to create a hypergate in orbit around the planet alpha prime to enable the rescue of earth to begin however others have different reasons for reaching alpha prime and dr smith sabotages the jupiter 2 but fails to get clear and becomes an unwelcome stowaway aboard the ship to escape the gravitational pull of the sun the hyperdrive is fired and the jupiter 2 after a trip through hyperspace emerges into a completely unknown part of the galaxy a search of the star charts reveals that they are completely lost in an uncharted sector of space but this is only the beginning of their problems the year is 2058 most of the earths natural resources are virtually exhausted and will no longer support human life the government decides that another planet shall be the human races new home and the government begins construction of two hypergates that will allow the human race to travel across space to the distant planet alpha prime government scientist professor john robinson decides to set up a vital space mission along with his family his wife maureen their children oldest daughter medical officer judy troubled teenage daughter video technician penny and their youngest son gifted robotics expert will and joined by heroic military fighter pilot major don west john and his crew travels to alpha prime onboard the spaceship jupiter 2 but the traitorous dr zachary smith working for terrorists known as the seditions uses the ships robot and sabotages the mission and sends jupiter 2 offcourse but as jupiter 2 is caught in the gravitational pull of the sun john uses the ships hyperdrive to escape but john his family and major west learns that theyve entered a uncharted part of the galaxy and they are lost in space in the year 2058 earth will soon be uninhabitable after the irreversible effects of pollution the united global space force serves as the planetary government professor john robinson william hurt lead scientist of the jupiter mission will lead his family wife dr maureen robinson mimi rogers daughters dr judy robinson heather graham and penny lacey chabert and son will jack johnson to the habitable planet alpha prime to prepare it for colonization by building a hypergate in orbit the jupiter 2 is equipped with a hyperdrive that allows fasterthanlight travel which will eventually be employed to evacuate the citizens of earth however hypergates must be constructed on earth and alpha prime to provide stable points of departure and arrival the project is accelerated after global sedition terrorist forces send two armed fighters to destroy the hypergate under construction major don west matt leblanc a fighter pilot from the hypergate defense force manages to destroy the enemy fighters and is unwillingly drafted as the new pilot of the jupiter mission as the previous pilot has been assassinated it is also a form of punishment for west since he disobeyed orders during the battle to rescue a comradedr zachary smith gary oldman the missions medical expert is bribed by the global sedition to sabotage the mission and is betrayed by his employers left an unwilling stowaway as the ship blasts off the sabotage by the robot altered program causes the ship to veer towards the sun realizing that it would be impossible to escape the suns pull at such close range major west and professor robinson decide to fly through the sun using the ships hyperdrive unfortunately without a hypergate to warp to the ship and its crew end up in a random and apparently uncharted part of the galaxy they then go through a hole in space and presumably to the future soon afterwards they encounter the proteus an earth ship from the future which has been infested with carnivorous and cannibalistic siliconbased spiderlike lifeforms one of which scratches dr smith major west destroys the proteus annihilating the spiders and annoying professor robinson their disagreement being interrupted by maureen however the shock wave from the explosion has damaged the jupiter 2 and they crashland on a nearby planeton the mysterious planet they locate a fuel source with which to refuel the damaged engines of the jupiter 2 however it lies in the center of a strange growing bubble of mysterious origin professor robinson and major west explore the bubble and discover it is actually an area of time distortion where alternate future versions of dr smith and will have constructed a time machine powered by their jupiter 2s power core and are planning on returning to earth at an earlier time to prevent the family from getting lost in the first place they are all betrayed by the future smith who is revealed to have transformed into a giant space spiderhuman hybrid as a result of the wound he received on the proteus he then reveals his plan to go back in time to earth before the jupiter 2 lifts off destroy the ship and conquer the planet to spread his spider race across the earth robinson battles spider smith while major west returns to the other jupiter 2 without the power source to try to evacuate the other robinsons john successfully stops spider smith by stabbing a dagger into the eggsac on his back causing cannibalistic baby spiders to come out and start eating spider smith and tackling spider smith into the time machines field while it is too small for his massive form killing himthe family attempts to escape but the time bubble has made the planet unstable and it is violently breaking apart in addition the ship still does not have enough power to reach escape velocity the stranded john robinson watches as the jupiter 2 is hit by debris and explodes in the sky future will realizes his father does indeed love his family and lets john use the time portal and travel back in time to the jupiter 2 just before it launched from his planet rather than attempt to escape into the atmosphere john commands west to pilot the ship through the planets core as it is breaking up enabling them to use the planets gravity to propel the ship through the other side they escape but the collapsed planet forms a small black hole that begins to suck in the jupiter 2 once again the robinsons must activate the hyperdrive however this time they are able to target alpha prime using data downloaded from the proteus more detailed star charts they are presumably transported to alpha prime but this is uncertain as the film ends right as the robinsons and west activate the hyperdrive
