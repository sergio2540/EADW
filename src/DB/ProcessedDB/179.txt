droogs next head out into the dark countryside looking for action alex pilots their stolen durango 95 sports car after playing hogs of the road driving on the wrong side of the road and running a number of other travelers into ditches and over embankments alex suggests making the surprise visit stopping at a fancy country house that displays a backlighted sign that simply reads home they trick their way into the house they beat its owner a writer named frank alexander patrick magee and gang rape his wife adrienne corri while alex brightly croons singin in the rainwhen theyve finished having fun the gang returns to the korova a woman seated at an adjacent table sings the chorus from beethovens 9th symphony listening to the woman alex is ecstatic  i felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise  but dim ruins the mood when he makes a farting noise alex hits him in the crotch with his truncheon henceforth dim is resentful and threatening but alex dismisses himdawn is nigh as alex arrives at his apartment before going to bed he fantasizes scenes of violence while listening to beethovens 9th symphonyin the morning alexs mother sheila raynor tries to wake alex for school but he feigns illness at the breakfast table she discusses the situation with his father philip stone alexs parents seem foolish and impotent when alex later awakens and wanders about the apartment in his underwear he encounters his probation officer mr deltoid aubrey morris in his parents bedroom  deltoid is so much a member of the family that alexs mother had given him a key the officer lectures alex about his school truancy and threatens him with jail then deltoid is abashed when he discovers that in addition to water the bedside glass from which hes been drinking also contains a set of denturesafter deltoid leaves alex begins another busy day he picks up two girls at a local shopping mall record store and brings them home in a spedup sequence backed by the william tell overture he has sex with both of themlater that day he encounters his droogs in his apartment house lobby they ominously tell him that theyve been talking they feel that alex has been abusing them especially dim and they suggest that alex has been taking more than his fair share of the spoils from their robberies then georgie shares an idea to make lots more money he wants to rob a rich lady who owns an upscale health farm at the edge of town alex perceives georgies independent thinking as a threat but appears to go along with it he then unexpectedly attacks his droogs as they walk along a river bank outside the apartment block he throws first georgie and then dim into the dirty river water when alex offers to help pull dim out of the water he slashes the back of dims outstretched hand with a hidden dagger alex makes the excuse that the sound of beethoven from an open window inspired his violence but his droogs dont believe him they all retire to a restaurant where alex first humiliates his droogs then considers georgies ideaarriving at the health farm that evening the droogs try the same trick theyd used at alexanders house the previous night tricking the woman in the house into believing that one of them has been injured in a traffic accident however the proprietress miriam karlin is suspicious and calls the police telling them that shed heard the news reports about the writer and his wife being tricked in the same manner when the droogs arent let into the house alex climbs up a drainpipe enters a second floor window and confronts her they fight the woman defending herself with a bust of beethoven until alex strikes her with a huge plastic phallus sculpture then as police sirens are heard in the distance alex runs out the front door it is there and then that his droogs take their revenge dim hits alex in the face with a milk bottle and the droogs flee as alex writhes and screams on the ground the police arriveat a police station an uncooperative and belligerent alex is questioned by several cops when an overzealous beat cop punches alex in his bandaged face for no reason alex kicks the officer in the groin the other officers then beat alex until deltoid shows up deltoid tells alex that the proprietress of the health farm has died and he spits in alexs face and tells him how disappointed he is alex laughs it off but is soon headed for prisonprisonalex has received a 14year sentence he deposits his possessions with chief officer barnes michael bates undresses and is inspected for hemorrhoids after answering several questions about his health and personal well being alex is given prison garb hes now prisoner number 655321two years have passed when alex is shown scheming to get favors by feigning piety he helps the prison chaplain godfrey quigley with his service and he studies the bible but rather than thinking pious thoughts alex visualizes himself torturing jesus at the crucifixion killing people in battle and laying about with concubines in an old testament settingalex tells the chaplain that hes heard of a new treatment the socalled ludovico technique that helps criminals get out of prison the chaplain says that its experimental and that hes not sure its right for alex but alex who wants a way out of prison life plots how to be selected for the experiment later the governments interior minister anthony sharp visits the prison and when alex makes a show of himself the minister picks alex as a perfect ludovico subject alex is taken before the prison governor michael gover who tells the boy that although hed rather punish him alex will shortly be releasedthe ludovico techniquechief officer barnes then transports alex to the ludovico centre alex is given a room and is interviewed by dr branom madge ryan she promises him that hell be fine then gives him an injectionin his first day of treatment alex appears in an auditorium in a straight jacket his head is strapped to the back of a restraining chair so that he can neither turn his head nor look away an eye doctor installs lidclamps that forcibly keep alexs eyes open then while the doctor constantly drops eye wash into alexs grotesquely clamped eyes alex is subjected to two violent films the first shows explicit scenes of a severe beating the second a gang rape half way through the first film alex begins to feel sick by the end of the second alex is shouting for something into which to vomit at the rear of the auditorium dr brodsky carl duering explains to observers that the drug administered to alex causes a form of paralysis with deep feelings of terror and helplessness in his room following the treatment dr branom assures alex that his feeling of sickness is a sign that hes getting betteron the following day alex is back in the auditorium this time for two shows morning and afternoon then while viewing scenes of nazis during world war ii alex begins screaming in earnest stop it stop it please i beg you its a sin the background music is none other than beethovens 9th symphony alex screams that he shouldnt be made to feel sick while listening to such beautiful music brodsky loudly apologizes saying that it cant be helped while quietly he speculates to nearby staff that perhaps this is the punishment element and wouldnt the prison governor be pleasedtwo weeks later presumably after 12 more treatments alex is paraded before a group of dignitaries by the interior minister alex is there for demonstration purposes he is first confronted by an angry irishman john clive who throws him to the ground and forces alex to lick his boot next hes approached by a statuesque platinum blond virginia wetherell clad only in panties she comes right up to alex and tempts him alex collapses in a fit of nausea when he tries to touch her breasts the interior minister proclaims a new era in law enforcement and social justice but the prison chaplain claims that the procedure has debased alexs human nature by taking away his ability to actually choose good over evil the interior minister counter claims that the only thing that matters is resultswelcome homealex returns home to find his parents plus a stranger clive francis sitting in the living room reading newspaper accounts of his release he enters and tries to be friendly but is met only by awkward excuses when he inquires about the stranger eating toast on the couch his father tells him that the stranger is a lodger who cant be kicked out because hes already paid the next months rent alex is upset but the lodger who has ingratiated himself with alexs parents pushes the situation by castigating alex for the things he did before going to prison and for breaking his parents hearts before alex can hit the lodger his psychological conditioning kicks in leaving him gagging and fighting for air when he has recovered alex storms outalex later stares at the thames river below a bridge presumably contemplating suicide hes approached by a bum seeking spare change alex fishes some cash from his pocket and hands it over then taking a closer look the bum recognizes alex as the same guy who beat him in the subway tunnel two years earlier alex looks at the bum in horror and tries to escape but is trapped in the very same tunnel by the bum and his elderly compatriots they hit and kick alex as he cowers on the ground disabled by his conditioning two cops show up to break up the fight to alexs further horror his rescuers turn out to be dim and georgie two of his former droogs who are now constables demonstrating that police training hasnt altered their basic violent natures they handcuff alex drive him out of town march him into a wood push his head into a cattle trough filled with filthy water and beat him with their batons they then remove the cuffs and leave him battered and gasping with thoughts of home echoing in his head alex staggers to the first house he can find it displays a welcoming backlighted sign that simply reads homeat home frank alexander is at his typewriter sitting in the wheelchair that has been his personal transport since he was severely beaten two years earlier julian david prowse his muscular attendant answers the doorbell as julian opens the door alex collapses into the entryway julian carries him into the housewhen confronted by a concerned mr alexander who asks my god whats happened to you my boy alex who now realizes hes at the very same residence in which two years earlier he and his droogs had ganged raped alexanders wife is thunderstruck by his precarious situation but he relaxes when he realizes that mr alexander doesnt recognize him voiceover for in those carefree days i and my socalled droogs wore our maskies which were like real horrorshow disguises mr alexander who recognizes alex only as the subject of the ludovico treatment invites the lad to have a bath and some supperas alex relaxes in the bath mr alexander calls a friend with whom he discusses how alexs ludovico conditioning represents the thin edge of totalitarianism and how that can be used against the sitting government as he finishes the conversation alexander leaves the impression that the time for a visit has been arranged when he looks at his watch and replies hell be here he then hangs up the phonemr alexander sits in his wheelchair relishing a fantasy of political intrigue when he becomes aware of singing coming from the bathroom in his bath alex has struck up a bright rendition of singin in the rain mr alexanders face twists in agony and rage as he realizes just who alex islater at the dinner table an obviously distraught mr alexander encourages alex to eat and drink flanked by the wheelchairbound mr alexander and the burly julian alex eats a plate of spaghetti while mr alexander insists that alex have some red wine with his meal try the wine have another mr alexander tells alex as he eats alex grows increasingly fearful wondering if the hostilelooking old man knows his real identity then mr alexander brings up the subject of his wifes rape and subsequent death he believes that though she officially died of pneumonia it was her broken spirit that killed her she was according to mr alexander a victim of the modern age just as alex is a victim of the modern age he tells alex that two friends are expected and that they will help the boya minute later man named dolin john savident and a woman margaret tyzack enter they question alex about the ludovico treatment and whether it is true that in addition to conditioning him against sex and violence it has also made him incapable of listening to music no missus alex replies you see its not all music its just the 9th they ask what he feels when he hears beethovens 9th symphony and he admits to thoughts of suicide the woman then asks do you still feel suicidal alex replies that he feels low like any second something terrible is going to happen to me at which point he passes out face down into the plate of spaghetti he has been drugged by the wine dolin congratulates mr alexander who then asks julian to bring the car around to the front the conspirators have plans for alex that will embarrass the governmentalex awakens the next morning in a small second floor bedroom in an unknown country house the room is flooded with the strains of beethovens 9th symphony blasted from a stereo in the room below voiceover i woke up the pain and sickness all over me like an animal as mr alexander beams in satisfaction alex is driven to suicide he leaps from the second floor window to the stone patio belowcureddays or maybe weeks or months later alex wakes up in a hospital with legs arms and head in casts newspaper clippings reveal that the government is being vilified for inhuman experimentation the interior minister is being subjected to especially fierce attack when his parents visit alex gives them their much deserved final rejectionlater doctor taylor pauline taylor a psychiatrist with blue hair shows alex a series of cartoons having sexual or violent connotations alex is to supply the punch lines she is testing him to determine whether his ludovico conditioning is still active it isntlater still the interior minister visits alex he assures alex that he wants to be his friend with oily smoothness welllarded with weasel words the minister apologizes for what his government has done he promises alex a good job on a good salary provided of course that alex helps the government we always help our friends dont we he assures the lad that the subversive writer frank alexander who has been threatening him has been put away for his part alex milks the meeting for all its worth as the aristocratic minister spoonfeeds dinner to the juvenile thug alex asks the name of his new friend decorously clearing his throat the minister replies that his name is frederick he tells alex that he can be instrumental in changing public opinion do you understand alex he asks do i make myself clear as an unmuddied lake fred is alexs response as a symbol of their understanding the minister calls for his assistants they sweep in with flowers followed by a massive stereo system blasting beethovens 9th symphony followed by a troop of reporters and photographers alex poses with his new friend fred as the choral climax of beethovens 9th symphony reaches its zenith alexs eyes roll back into his head as he fantasizes about an orgy in the snow with a gorgeous blond to the applause of victorian onlookersalex is heard in
