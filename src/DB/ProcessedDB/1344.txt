Plot:
A study in the seemingly rank unfairness of Chinese culture toward women, this is an excellent film. Our heroine has a particularly raw deal, matched (or more correctly, purchase by) to a cruel, but well off husband. His only interest is to have a son, but Xinghua does not become pregnant, bringing great hardship on herself. I liked the movie, although it was a little long and some of the characters could have been developed more, like Nizi, the husband's sister. If you accept the movie as a real depiction of life in rural China, it is a wonderful, but depressing view of the Chinese twist to life's complications.
