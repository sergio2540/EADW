rolf kralovitz ira moore marshall rainer roger vagnoid the futility and irony of the war in the trenches in wwi is shown as a unit commander in the french army must deal with the mutiny of his men and a gloryseeking general after part of his force falls back under fire in an impossible attack in paths of glory war is viewed in terms of power this film about a true episode in world war i combines the idea that class differences are more important than national differences with the cannonfodder theory of war the theory that soldiers are merely pawns in the hands of generals who play at war is if it were a game of chess a voiceover narrator explains that germany and france entered world war i in august 1914 and with the construction of a continuous line of fortified trenches stretching from switzerland to the english channel a costly military stalemate set in by 1916 successful attacks were measured in thousands of yards and paid for by casualties in the hundreds of thousandsgeneral george broulard adolphe menjou an elderly general and member of the french general staff arrives from paris at the headquarters a magnificent chateau of his subordinate general paul mireau george macready to inform him that a major offensive is planned for general mireaus sector and in preparation for this offensive general broulard wants mireaus division to capture a welldefended german position nicknamed the anthill mireau balks at the idea claiming that his division is in no condition to defend the anthill much less capture it broulard reluctantly mentions that in a completely unrelated matter he was thinking that mireau was due for a promotion not that this should sway his decision concerning the feasibility of an attack on the anthill  after explaining to broulard at great length that the men he commands mean more to him than all the stars and decorations in france the ambitious mireau concludes by stating that an attack on the anthill just might workmireau undertakes an inspection of the front line trenches with his loyal and cynical staff officer major saintauban richard anderson the general stops to ask several soldiers who later become major characters the question ready to kill more germans when one soldier fred bell fails to answer merely staring straight ahead his comrades reply that the soldier is suffering from shell shock mireau states there is no such thing as shell shock and when the general enquires about whether the soldier has a wife the soldier replies that hell never see her again since hes certain to be killed to which mireau scolds the soldier for acting like a coward when the soldier replies that he is a coward mireau flies into a rage and strikes the soldier across the face yelling that he wants this little baby transferred out of the regiment as they continue through the trenches maj saintauban says that the general was right to do what he did and adds that he thinks that the high morale of the 701st regiment is the direct result of the generals inspections which mireau denies stating that their fighting spirit was just born in themthe commander of the 701st regiment colonel dax kirk douglas is greeted in his headquarters bunker by mireau when maj saintauban makes a disparaging remark about the enlisted men dax takes offense and mireau asks the major to leave them alone to discuss the coming assault dax is informed by mireau of his plan to launch an attack on the anthill for which dax shows little enthusiasm mireau criticizes daxs lack of enthusiasm and threatens to have him relieved from command if he does not agree to his plan not wishing to be taken away from my men the colonel reluctantly agrees that the 701st regiment will attempt to take the anthillthat night a patrol is ordered to be sent out to reconnoiter nomans land the space between the opposing trenches corporal paris ralph meeker is among the two men chosen to accompany the halfdrunk lieutenant roget wayne morris on this patrol cpl paris fellow soldier remarks that the corporal does seem to like the lieutenant to which cpl paris replies that he knew roget before the war and didnt have much respect for him then either lt roget having sought to bolster his courage with alcohol leads the patrol through the barbed wire waterfilled shell holes and general wreckage that is nomans land when they come to a halt lt roget orders the third member of the patrol to scout forward on his own against the objections of cpl paris as they wait for the third soldier to return lt roget becomes increasingly nervous stating he must have been killed finally in a panic lt roget throws a grenade into the darkness and runs back to the french lines leaving cpl paris behind cpl paris crawling forward discovers the third soldier lying in a shell hole having been killed by lt rogets grenadea little later when cpl paris shows up at lt rogets command bunker the lieutenant acts as if hes happy to see that the corporal is still alive but cpl paris confronts him with his crimes drunk on duty cowardice in the face of the enemy killing a fellow soldier etc lt roget pretends to be sorry and points out that a court of inquiry is more likely to believe the word of a lieutenant than that of a corporal so paris might as well forget it all happened at that moment col dax arrives to pick up the report on the patrol but lt roget states that it isnt finished yet dax clearly sees theres something going on between roget and paris but doesnt pursue the matterdax has a final meeting with his officers to explain how the attack on the following day will proceed one officer asks what the weather is supposed to be like to which the colonel replies too good meaning no rain or fog to provide cover for the troops advancing across nomans land another officer asks how long they will have to hold the anthill once theyve captured it dax replies that they will have to hold it against enemy counterattacks for the entire day while the officers discuss the details of the assault the enlisted men consider what they will face in the morning conversing in whispers with a fellow soldier private arnaud joseph turkel considers what his fellow soldiers are most afraid of poison gas high explosive shells a bayonet in the gut he points out that what everyone is afraid of is pain not death since everyone knows that hes going to die some day his fellow soldier rolling over to get some sleep replies youre too smart for me professor all i know is nobody wants to diethe following morning mireau accompanied by his ever faithful lackey maj saintauban stands in an observation post waiting for the attack to commence he offers his fellow officers a drink and they respectfully decline leaving the general to toast the success of the assault on his ownin the trenches dax is walking past the men of the 701st regiment who are pressed up against the sides for cover against the artillery barrage which is intended to screen the men as they advance towards the enemy this was known as a creeping barrage the shells roar overhead and many fall perilously close showering dax and his men with clods of dirt and waves of dust in his initial discussion with dax about the assault mireau including a figure for the likely percentage of men who would be killed by their own barrage when calculating the possible casualties this was in fact an unavoidable reality in the first world war a whistle between his teeth and a revolver in his hand dax climbs a ladder as sergeant boulanger bert freed staring at his wristwatch counts down three two one zero blowing on his whistle and waving his men to go over the top a mass of french soldiers emerge from their trenches out into the open of nomans land carrying heavy packs with their bayonets fixed the men move forward as fast as possible over torn remnants of barbed wire down into and up out of shell craters seemingly an inexorable wave but shells burst amongst them and enemy machine gun fire can be heard the men go down a soldier here another there and more and more fall individually and in heaps others behind them step over the bodies only to drop and add to the piles in the deafening confusion covered in mud dax asks a sergeant next to him where b company is to which the sergeant replies he doesnt knowmireau in his observation post also notices the failure of b company to advance the general flies into a rage and orders his artillery to commence shelling the trenches occupied by the troops of b company in order to force them to advance if only to escape from the shelling the battery commander captain rousseau john stein refuses to comply with mireaus order sir you have no right to order me to shoot down my own men without an order in writing and signed by the general what if youre killed then where will i be the psychopath mireau replies youll be in front of a firing squad thats where youll be hand over your command and place yourself under arrest for an immediate courtmartialmeanwhile dax racing through the wreckage of his trenches reaches lt roget and b company the drunk roget pleads with dax that theyve already tried twice and taken far too many casualties ignoring him dax climbs a ladder while blowing on his whistle trying to encourage the men to give it another try only to have a dead soldier falling from above knock him off the ladder around them all of the soldiers are falling back to their trenches mireau is informed in his observation post that the attack has failed all along the line to which he instructs major saintauban to have the 701st regiment pulled out of the line and to assemble a general courtmartial if those little sweethearts wont face german bullets theyll face french onesthe following day dax meets with broulard and mireau at headquarters where the cynical mireau accuses the entire 701st regiment of cowardice and proposes to have 100 men from the regiment randomly executed dax strongly objects and broulard intervenes to break up their argument broulard states that they dont want to slaughter the french army they just want to set an example to which dax replies that if its an example thats needed the logical choice is the officer most responsible for the attack implying of course that if anyone should face a firing squad it should in fact be the scumbag general mireau broulard loses his temper and shouts this is not a question of officers regaining his composure broulard suggests that one man from each of the regiments three companies should be chosen to be tried for cowardice in the face of the enemy although he initially objects mireau accepts broulards proposal before they leave dax requests to be appointed the defence attorney for the accused men and broulard agrees chiding mireau for hiding dax an obviously talented officer from him earlier in the film its established that dax was one of frances top attorneys before the war outside in the hallway mireau confronts dax and virtually orders him to step down as the defense attorney but the colonel refuses mireau rails against him for his apparent disloyalty and promises to ruin his career when this is over when mireau catches up with broulard they are met by the battery commander captain rousseau who states that mireau had ordered him to meet with the general thinking fast mireau lies and says that he wanted to speak to the captain about some of his shells falling short and dismisses him broulard recommends a public hearing the last thing mireau wants but mireau talks broulard out of it and the matter is forgottendax meets with the three accused men they include the intellectual private arnaud who complains that he was randomly picked by lot cpl paris who claims that lt roget chose him because he knows what roget did during the patrol in nomans land the night before the battle and private ferol timothy carey who claims that he was chosen because his company commander considered him to be a social degenerate dax explains that the reason they were chosen is irrelevant since they are all charged with cowardice he explains that he doesnt have much time the trial is that afternoon and he needs to prepare dax urges them to show the same courage that they have shown in the face of the enemyat the chateau arnaud paris and ferol sit in chairs in front of a group of officers behind tables in a large room the officer serving as the chief judge of the court martial peter capell begins the proceedings by calling one of the men to testify but dax immediately objects pointing out that the men have the right to hear the charges against them read out the officer serving as the chief judge states that the court does not wish to waste time with technicalities and that basically the charges are that these three men showed cowardice in the face of the enemy during the attack on the anthill having been appointed by mireau as the prosecutor maj saintauban grills each of the three men in turn with dax crossexamining them to show that they are not cowards all to little avail the entire trial is a farce as dax sees his mens rights violated by the cynical military judges whom are clearly acting under the orders of mireau sitting nearby and dax being barred from entering any evidence relating to the casein his closing argument to the judges saintauban states that the actions of the 701st regiment during the attack on the anthill was a stain on the honor of france and as such asks the court to find these men guilty and impose the penalty of death to make an example of them afterwards dax complains in his summation about the nature of the trial mireau speaks up asking dax if he questions the legitimacy of the court to which dax replies that he objects to the fact that he was given practically no time to prepare his case no written indictment was ever made against the accused that he was prevented from introducing evidence that would have been vital for the defense that the prosecution presented no witnesses to back up their claims and on top of all that that no stenographic records of the trial were being kept he states that the attack by the 701st regiment on the antihill was no stain on the honor of france but this trial is such a stain he warns the officers serving as judges gentlemen of the court to find these men guilty would be a crime to haunt each of you till the day you die and pleads for mercy the judges adojurn to deliberatethe next day sgt boulanger is placed in charge of the guards for the prisoners strides up and down the line of men under his command explaining the regulations and pointing out that he has been made personally responsible for anything that happens involving these prisoners but that he will ensure that if there are any mistakes he will pass on any punishment with interest to the men under his commandinside the stable in which they are being held arnaud paris and ferol consider their options ferol thinks hes going to get out of it somehow paris is worried what his wife will think eyeing a cockroach on the table paris ruminates over the fact that if hes executed the cockroach will have more contact with his wife and children than he will it will be alive while hell be dead ferol slams his hand down on the table and mutters now youve got the edge on him dinner is brought in to the men ferol is suspicious that the food is drugged to make them groggy arnaud thinks ferol is being stupid but ferol refuses to eat anyway finally a priest emile meyer arrives with news of the verdict theyve all been found guilty and will be executed in the morning ferol breaks down and the priest tries to comfort him the priest asks paris if he would like to make his confession but paris says that hes not a religious man and that if he began praying now he would feel like a hypocrite the priest tells him that that would be an error and promises him that god is there for him and that death comes to us all arnaud being eaten alive by the injustice of their situation doesnt take this well and mocks the priest holding up a bottle of wine he is drinking and pretends to pray to it the priest says that he is there to help them but arnaud replies that back in his home town there was a cafe with an amusing sign above the bar that read do not be afraid to ask for credit for our way of refusing is very polite arnaud becomes increasingly angry while paris tries to restrain him but he breaks free and punches the priest paris then gets between them and warns arnaud not to try anything but arnaud lunges forward and paris is forced to slug him arnaud stumbles backwards hitting his head on a stone column and a doctor is summoned having patched him up as best he could the doctor remarks that arnaud has a very serious skull fracture and he may not live through the night the priest asks whether they intend to execute a man in this condition but the doctor informs him that the death sentence will be carried out and recommends pinching his cheek to wake him up in the morning if he still alive since mireau wants him to be conscious when hes executed that same night lt roget arrives at daxs quarters asking what the colonel wanted to see him about dax asks roget why he chose cpl paris to be court martialed stating that of course the lieutenant had no personal motives for picking paris visibly nervous roget replies that of course he had no personal reasons for choosing paris it was just that someone had to be chosen dax explains that he has the same problem he has to find someone to be in charge of the firing squad and asks lt roget if he would like the assignment taken aback roget protests by telling dax he has never overseen an execution before dax explains that it is a simple matter the two primary responsibilities are to offer the men a blindfold and to put a bullet in each mans head after the firing squad has finished despite additional protests by roget dax dismisses him curtly from his quarters telling him hes got the job as roget is leaving the battery commander captain rousseau enters and tells the colonel that he has some information that may have an important bearing on the court martialsbroulard is attending a lavish ball for general officers and other dignitaries when he is called away to the library where he privately meets colonel dax dax confesses that his is not entirely a social visit and the general protests that he doesnt want to go back over the whole affair though he admits that judging from the casualty reports the 701st regiment did make a serious effort dax asks him why if that is true the three men should be executed broulard points out that perhaps the attack was doomed to fail but on the other hand with a little more effort the 701st might have captured the anthill broulard then gently accuses dax of taking a narrow view of things reminding him that the general staff is subjected to all sorts of unfair pressures from the press and politicians moreover theres the matter of the troops morale you see colonel troops are like children and just as a child wants his father to be firm troops crave discipline and one way to ensure discipline is to shoot a man now and again dax asks the general rhetorically do you sincerely believe the things youve just said broulard making a tactical retreat excuses himself to return to the party but as they walk towards the door dax brings up the subject of mireaus order for his artillery to fire on his own troops during the attack broulard immediately slams the door to the library shut and turns around to face dax while he continues to describe what happened the general asks dax if he expects him to believe something so fantastic dax produces the signed statements of battery commander rousseau the telephone operator and his own observations asking the general what the press and politicians would do with such material should it ever be made public losing his temper broulard shouts are you trying to blackmail me dax calmly explains that too much has happened and someone has to take the blame the question is who a general launches an impossible attack and on the same day orders his artillery to fire on his own men but when that same general tries to have three innocent men executed those men are saved by the intervention of the general staff broulard pauses for a moment with the documents in his hand looking up at dax if youll excuse me colonel ive been rude to my guests for too long broulard exits the room leaving dax aloneat dawn the next morning sgt boulanger opens the door to the stable to announce that its time to leave cpl paris struggling to act normal tells the sergeant that he missed some great food the previous night when the sergeant asks what they had paris cant answer but asks if the sergeant has anything to drink the sergeant hands him a canteen and tells him to take a swig paris begins to laugh telling the sergeant that remarkably he hasnt had one sexual thought since the court martial and then crumbles to the ground weeping the sergeant tells paris to pull himself together but paris sobbing asks why he has to die the sergeant reminds him that many of his comrades are likely to die in the near future in combat but paris still sobbing says he doesnt care he still doesnt want to die finally sgt boulanger tells paris that they have to go and that there are reporters present how does he want to be remembered by his wife and children either he can walk out or be dragged out in the end its the same cpl paris collects himself stands up and puts on his capwith the rolling sound of drums in the background the men of the 701st regiment standing at attention are lined up on both sides of a path in a huge courtyard in front of a chateau on a beautiful sunny morning the three condemned men slowly make their way down the path paris marching upright staring straight ahead arnaud unconscious and strapped to a stretcher is carried along and ferol completely unhinged sobbing uncontrollably has his arm around the priests who is accompanying him they pass row upon row of soldiers they pass the regimental band drums still rolling they pass a press photographer who takes their picture they pass broulard and mireau and they pass dax finally they reach the posts they will be tied to in front of a wall of sandbags off to the side is a flatbed wagon with three coffins on it the drums stop the only noise is the sound of the firing squads boots on the loose gravel as they march into position with the cowardly lt roget in command roget walks forward with blindfolds arnauds stretcher is tilted up against the pole and the sergeant pinches his cheek in a groggy state arnaud looks with horror at the scene and appears to pass out once more skipping arnaud roget offers ferol a blindfold and still crying he accepts roget then comes over to paris and asks if he wants a blindfold paris angrily says no roget meekly says hes sorry for what hes done to him paris doesnt speak but nods his head implying that he accepts rogets apology roget marches back to the firing squad while major saintauban comes forward and in a weak and halting voice in complete contrast to his performance as the evil and cynical prosecutor he reads out loud the orders for the execution for a moment the only sounds are the chirping of the birds on a sunny morning lt roget shouts out ready aim firea little later in the château over breakfast mireau expresses his pleasure that the executions went so well that none of the condemned men spoiled it by doing something that would leave a bad taste in everyones mouth it had a certain splendor about it  broulard choosing his words carefully notes that he has never seen an affair of this kind carried out so well when dax arrives the gloating mireau compliments him on his men dying well  angry and disgusted dax says nothing suddenly and to daxs surprise broulard mentions to mireau that the colonel had come to him the night before claiming that during the attack on the anthill mireau had ordered his artillery to fire on his own men mireau flatly denies the allegation but dax states that he has signed testimony from numerous witnesses broulard says that it doesnt matter for hes certain that the general will come through it come through what asks mireau with concern there will have to be an investigation an inquiry but broulard notes the public will forget horrified general mireau stands up and shouts so im the scapegoat the only completely innocent man in this whole affair  aware that his military career days are numbered the clearly insane mireau storms out of the room claiming himself to be a true soldierafter mireau leaves broulard openly comments that frances armies and military destiny cannot be guided by arrogant fools like general mireau and then turning to dax asks how would you like to have general mireaus job dax is again taken completely by surprise and states youre offering me general mireaus command the elderly general responds come come my boy we all know youve been after it from the start  dax then responds angrily stating i am a lot of things but i am not your boy broulard sternly tells dax not to get defensive around him but with mireaus days in the french army numbered and aware that he will be forced to resign his command regardless of the inquiry to be brought on him his command needs a replacement and broulard assumes that dax will do just right and it would be a shame for dax to lose the promotion before it is ever given to him dax replies general would you like me to suggest what you can do with that promotion broulard immediately becomes furious with dax for implying what he means and shouts colonel dax you shall apologize at once or i will have you placed under arrest speaking in a subtle tone that quickly turns into anger dax replies i apologize for not being completely honest i apologize for not showing my true feelings i apologize for not telling you sooner that youre a sick degenerate heartless sadistic old man and you can go to hell before i apologize to you now or ever againbriefly stunned by daxs furious and defiant outburst broulard slumps back and sighs now realizing that he was wrong about dax in a calm tone broulard shakes his head and responds by saying colonel dax you are a disappointment to me youve spoiled the keenness of your mind by wallowing in sentimentality you really did want to save those three men and you were not angling for general mireaus command the impassive and unfeeling broulard then ridicules dax by adding youre not a soldier youre an idealist for that i pity you as i would the village idiot were fighting a war dax a war weve got to win those men wouldnt fight so i had them shot certainly not true you brought charges against mireau so i demanded that he answer to them wherein have i done wrong dax replies because you really dont know the answer to that i pity you for that dax leavesnow outside dax wanders over to a tavern where he hears men from his regiment having a good time its not clear if these are merely troops from the 701st or perhaps these are the men from the firing squad the proprietor jerry hausner brings a young german woman susanne christaina who is clearly frightened on stage to entertain the troops the men hoot and whistle and jeer talk in a civilized language one yells out dax standing outside cringes in disgust seeming to reflect his general disillusionment with not only generals mireau and broulard but the entire human race as a whole but as the girl begins to sing the german folk song the faithful hussar the catcalls and whistles gradually die down and the men captivated by the only decent innocent being theyve come in contact with for a very long time begin to hum along some of them even begin to shed tearsoutside the tavern sgt boulanger appears beore dax with word that the 701st regiment has been ordered to return to the front dax his faith in common humanity restored tells the sergeant to give the men a few minutes more and walks away to his office as his smile turns into a hardened look
