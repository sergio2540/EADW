war as a correspondent for stars and stripes focusing on the tet offensive a twosegment story that follows young men from the start of recruit training in the marine corps to the lethal cauldron known as vietnam the first segment follows joker pyle and others as they progress through the hell of usmc bootcamp at the hands of the colorful foulmouthed gunnery sergeant hartman the second begins in vietnam near hue at the time of the tet offensive joker along with animal mother rafterman and others face threats such as ambush booby traps and viet cong snipers as they move through the city full metal jacket begins by following the trials and tribulations of a platoon of fresh marine corps recruits focusing on the relationship between gunnery sergeant hartman and privates pyle and joker we see pyle grow into an instrument of death as hartman has foreseen of all of his recruits through pyles torment and jokers unwillingness to stand up against it the climax of part one is achieved with all three main characters deciding their fates by their action or inaction the second chapter delves into jokers psyche and the repeated referral to the fact that he joined the corps to become a killer when his mostly behind the scenes job as a combat correspondent is interfered with by the tet offensive he is thrust into real combat and ultimately must decide if he really is a killer during the vietnam war private joker the narrator a future author and his class are put through the us marine indoctrination and training under di gunnery sergeant hartmans verbally and physically abusive sexobsessed style its all far worse for fat simpleton pyle who keeps doing everything wrong even when gentle joker is appointed his personal tutor until peer pressure becomes group bullying on their last day at paris island when everyone graduates the psychological timebomb explodes only intellectual joker isnt assigned to jungle duty but as military war correspondent hes unwilling to play the deceptive propaganda game and violence catches up even in the safe city hue its the late 1960s at parris island south carolina the us marine corps training camp where a group of young marine recruits after having their heads shaved are being prepped for basic training by the brutal gunnery sergeant hartman r lee ermey whose orders are to weed out all nonhackers hartman gives each of the marines nicknames one pragmatic recruit who talks behind his back becomes joker matthew modine a texas recruit becomes cowboy arliss howard and finally leonard lawrence a 6foot 3inch 280 pound slowwitted recruit with no intelligence or ambition becomes gomer pyle vincent donofrio and the focus of hartmans brutality because the overweight boy cannot keep up with the other more physically fit recruits in the grueling obstacle coursesone morning during muster hartman asks joker if he believes in the virgin mary joker responds that he doesnt angering the catholic drill instructor the clearly religious hartman continues to ask joker if he believes in the virgin mary and joker continues to resist confirming that he doesnt because hes an atheist despite hartmans slapping him in the face joker stubbornly refuses to change his answer stating that he belives that hartman will only beat him harder if he reverses himself hartman immediately promotes joker to squad leader for having the courage to stand up to his drill instructor however hartman also gives joker the difficult job of being pyles personal instructor off on the sidelines over the next few days joker helps pyle through the obstacle courses shows him how to operate and clean a rifle and how to make his bed but all of this effort is later proven to be a wasteone evening during a routine inspection hartman noticing that pyles foot locker is unlocked searches it and finds a jelly doughnut food is strictly forbidden in the barracks and pyle is not permitted to eat donuts because hes overweight enraged hartman decides that from then on instead of punishing pyle hell punish all the other recruits in the platoon a few nights later the angry recruits attack pyle with soap bars wrapped in towels while cowboy gags him and a few others hold him down on his bed at first joker is reluctant to attack his friend but after cowboy persuades him joker hits pyle longer and harder than most of the others in his bunk joker covers his ears ashamed at himself for his actions while pyle howls in painafter the traumatic experience pyle slowly begins to go insane but also shapes up and becomes the fastest and quickest rifleman of the entire platoon impressing hartman when joker sees pyle talking to his rifle and staring off into space blankly and not responding to interaction he realizes that pyle is losing his mind section 8 and confides in cowboy about pyles growing mental breakdown by the end of basic training pyle clearly has been completely dehumanized by its rigorsafter graduation hartman assigns each recruit a mos military occupational specialty most of them as 0300 infantry one exception is joker who is assigned as a 4212 basic military journalism on the platoons last night on parris island joker draws fire watch guard patrol during which he discovers pyle in the bathroom loading his m14 rifle with live ammunition frightened joker attempts to calm the insane pyle who begins shouting executing drill commands and reciting the riflemans creed the noise awakens hartman who confronts pyle and demands that he drop the rifle when pyle refuses and does not respond hartman hurls further insults at him pyle responds by shooting hartman dead and then aims the rifle at joker joker pleads with pyle who lowers the rifle and nods possibly in recognition of joker as a friend pyle sits down on a toilet places the muzzle of the weapon in his mouth and kills himselfone year later joker is in da nang reporting on the vietnam war for the military newspaper stars and stripes he and his partner combat photographer rafterman kevyn major howard meet a prostitute leanne hong in the streets and encounter a thief nguyen hue phong who steals raftermans camera when they return to their base they are given

about his ability to killwhen they land outside hue joker and rafterman meet and talk to a lieutenant touchdown ed oross he tells joker who is looking for his old friend cowboy that hes cowboys commanding officer however before joker and rafterman meet the squad they follow up a rumor about vietnamese civilians who are reported to have been executed by the viet cong they go to the mass grave and find over 20 bodies in a mass grave that have been covered with lime joker talks to a lieutenant who confirms that the dead people were told by the viet cong theyd be reeducated at a public meeting and were killed when they arrived as they wrap up their coverage joker is approached and lectured by a belligerent colonel bruce boa who demands to know why joker wears a peace symbol on his body armor when he also has the words born to kill written on his helmet joker suggests it has to do with the duality of man according to jung the cynical colonel doesnt believe him and tells him to get with the programthey later meet the lusthog squad and are finally reunited with cowboy who has been promoted to sergeant and is secondincommand joker accompanies the squad during the battle of hue during the battle the enemy kills their commanding officer lt touchdown another marine nicknamed crazy earl kieron jecchinis takes command of the squad the group goes into battle and quickly comes

ruined buildings and a unseen sniper ngoc le pins them down wounding two of their comrades first eightball dorian harewood and then doc jay jon stafford when he tries to drag eightball to safety the

from her wounds or to put her out of her misery animal mother decides to allow a mercy killing only if joker performs it after some hesitation joker shoots her with his sidearm the marines sarcasticly congratulate him on his first kill as joker stares into the distance having finally gotten his dehumanized thousand yard starethe film concludes with a night time shot of joker rafterman animal mother
