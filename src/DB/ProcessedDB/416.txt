protect the dog arliss immediately adopts the dog and his mother approves encouraging travis to reconsider his feelings about having the dog aroundtravis really wants nothing to do with the dog but his feelings begin to change after he brings home a deer he shot and hangs the meat on the front porch warning the yellow dog not to touch it or hed pay the consequences travis then purposely lowers the meat so it will be easily within reach of the dog the next morning travis grabs his gun in anticipation and goes out onto the porch expecting the meat to be gone and thus providing a reason for him to shoot the dog however the meat is untouched and the yellow dog is lying quietly nearby the makes a great impression on travisarliss has taken to calling the dog yeller he rides yeller like a small horse takes him fishing yeller catches a catfish and they go swimming together in the familys spring water pool one day arliss is breaking off small pieces of bread and tossing them to a small black bear cub when the cub comes closer arliss jumps on it and tries to catch it the cub cries out and within moments the mother bear comes running heading right for arliss yeller flies into the picture and attacks the mother bear keeping her at bay until mrs coates rescues arliss that event confirms the complete acceptance and respect for yeller by travisbud searcy jeff york and his daughter elizabeth beverly washburn come by to check up on the coates family bud is a lazy bigmouthed sort who was left behind by the men of the community to look after the families while they were gone to kansas buds most redeeming points are his ability to show up around mealtime get his daughter to do any work that needs done and to tell exaggerated tales about his experiences and those of his family members elizabeth who is about travis age confides in travis that she has seen yeller stealing eggs and cornbread from members of the community she wont tell her father or anyone else however because she knows yeller is the father of the pups her dog is expecting and she doesnt think it would be nice to get the father of her dogs pups in troubletravis determines that one way to keep yeller from roaming and getting in further trouble is to put him on guard duty in the cornfield where raccoons have been eating the corn yeller does a good job of chasing off the coonsthe coates lone milk cow red goes off into the woods to birth her calf and travis takes yeller to go find them the cow being protective of her calf attacks travis and yeller intervenes and actually knocks the cow down twice before she decides to stop chasing travis travis carries the calf home while yeller herds red backred is still very upset having been tied to a fence without her calf nearby travis must attempt to milk her but she kicks at him so he calls to yeller to come help yeller slowly walks towards red stopping a few feet away and just stares at her she immediately calms down and presents no further problem mrs coates is amazedburn sanderson a rancher passing through from san antonio comes by the house and announces that he lost a big ol yellow dog recently he said the dog was an excellent cattle dog and he hoped to get him back mrs coates tells travis to go get yeller travis doesnt want to but he does as told as sanderson puts a rope around yellers neck and begins to ride away arliss picks up some rocks and throws them at sanderson that spooks sandersons horse and it bucks him off sanderson is a wise and kind person and he immediately realizes the impact yeller has made on this family in the short time hes been there he challenges arliss to approach him as though to deal with the matter mantoman he then offers to trade the yellow dog for the horned frog that arliss has in his pocket plus a womancooked meal arliss agrees and his mother helps with the meal part of the dealbefore he leaves sanderson releases the horned frog and confides in travis that there are cases of hydrophobia rabies showing up in the area he advises him not to delay in quickly dispatching any unusually aggressive animals he may come acrosstravis decides to try a method of catching some wild pigs that mr searcy had told him about it involves climbing into a low hanging branch having your dog herd the pigs under the branch lowering a rope noose to catch one pig at a time pulling it up notching its ear in effect branding it then continuing with the rest of the pigs travis and yeller collaborate well and he successfully marks one small pig but his second attempt is a larger pig and it pulls him out of the tree a boar with sharp tusks then attacks travis cutting his leg yeller saves him but in the process yeller is severely injured travis uses a neckerchief on his leg then wraps his shirt around yellers torso wound and helps him into a small cave for protection and runs for home mrs coates returns with travis arliss and jumper to see about yeller she sends arliss off to catch a green lizard for her to keep him busy while she uses one of jumpers tail hairs to sew up yellers wound they then use a travois to haul yeller home to recoverwhile travis and yeller are recovering mr searcy and elizabeth come by elizabeth brings with her a small yellow puppy one of yellers pups and offers it to travis travis says hes not interested and tells her to give it to arliss elizabeth is very hurt and deposits the puppy in arliss lap as she rushes out crying arliss is thrilled with the pupsome days later the hydrophobia makes its presence known in the form of the cow red becoming infected and going crazy travis must shoot the cow and while his mother and elizabeth are putting wood on a large fire to burn the carcass a wolf attacks them yeller is right on the spot and engages the wolf travis runs out with his rifle and when he has a clear shot he shoots the wolf dead yeller has some bite marks and mrs coates tells travis that he will need to shoot yeller too because hes no doubt infected as the wolf had been acting very strangely when it attacked travis convinces his mother to let him put yeller in a pen and observe himafter nearly four weeks of being penned yeller does in fact turn mean and snarls and snaps first at travis then arliss travis acknowledges the inevitable and goes to get his gun after considerable difficulty travis points the gun at yeller and pulls the trigger the next day mr coates returns home bearing gifts of a new dress and shoes for his wife an indian headbonnet and hatchet for arliss and a new horse for travis travis and elizabeth are in the process of burying yeller travis is despondent and doesnt respond as his father hoped he would upon seeing him and the new horse mr coates fully understands the situation however and counsels his sonmr coates tells travis that life can sometimes knock a person flat and make them hurt bad he says that people need to be careful that lifes bad events dont overwhelm them and cause all life to seem bad he explains that along with the bad in life theres also good and the good can be found if a person just looks for it travis is naturally skeptical and probably disbelieving but when he observes his mother getting angry at the little puppy for dragging off a slab of venison to chew on he immediately recognizes yellers character exhibiting itself in the pup and he smiles in recognition of what
