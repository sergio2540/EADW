with his life and spends most of his time inside his apartment writing books fortunately for melvin his books are popular for a reason that later becomes clear he is working on his sixtysixth bookmelvin finds himself bothered by verdell jill the dog a small terrier owned by neighbor simon bishop greg kinnear simon is an artistic painter living on the same floor simon is homosexual and somewhat passive simon has a good friend frank sachs cuba gooding jr who is black and rather aggressiveverdell escapes simons apartment and runs around the hallway annoying melvin melvin comes out and tries to calm verdell down but verdell stays out of reach and further annoys melvin by trying to pee by the wall finally melvin grabs verdell and stuffs him down the laundry chute just as melvin is about to open the door to his apartment simon comes out and asks about verdell naturally melvins highest priority is to get back to his comfortable routine so he lies and says he knows nothing about verdellsimon is suspicious but has to leave to answer an urgent phone call he is having an exhibition of his paintings that evening and has to see to final arrangements melvin naturally disappears into his apartmentat simons exhibition that evening a friend walks up carrying verdell simon is overjoyed to see verdell their reunion is joyful and happy with verdell excited and licking simons face simon is so happy to see verdell he lets verdell continue to lick his face simon asks his friend where he found verdell his friend says in the dumpster licking poop from baby diapers oops no more facelicking for verdellfrank realizes what happened and confronts melvin about verdell verbally abusing him but saying he wont tell simon and that melvin owes him onein the morning melvin goes out for his daily breakfast ritual he walks to a particular nearby cafe he sits at a particular table and if other people are sitting there he insults them until they leave he insists on being served by a particular waitress carol connelly helen hunt now most people may think that if a man insists on being served every day by the same waitress then the man has some kind of feelings toward her but we know since melvin is ocd that carol is simply part of the ritual along with that particular table and that particular cafe also part of the morning ritual is bringing his own plastic utensilsmelvin happily continues is daily rituals then one morning carol does not show up to serve him his breakfast melvin is naturally very upset so he proceeds in a very codlogical manner by insulting the substitute waitress and telling the manager to get carol the manager throws him out on the way out melvin bribes a busboy to get carols last name melvin uses that to find out where carol livesmelvin tries to restore his daily morning ritual so he goes to carols apartment carol is of course surprised to see him melvin demands that she come back to the cafe and serve him breakfast carol says she cannot her son spencer jesse james has congestion in his lungs so severe he can barely breathe while there spencers condition gets worse and carol leaves to take spencer to the emergency room at the hospital yet again carol and spencer get in the cab that brought melvin and melvin hops in the front seatat the hospital melvin sees how terrible this is for spencer and how much a preoccupation spencers condition is for carol you or i might feel compassion for spencer and empathy for carol but not ocd melvin he sees spencers condition as a powerful motive for carol sometimes not serving him breakfastmelvin takes steps to bring back his normal daily routine it happens that melvins editor has a husband martin bettes harold ramis who is a medical doctor melvin convinces his editor that her husband should see spencer as melvin leaves her office the secretary who was thrilled to see her favorite author insists on knowing melvins secret of connecting so well with women he turns says i think of a man and then i take away reason and accountability then he leaves the secretary is stunnedcarol comes home to see a nice car with md license plates parked in front of her apartment fearing something terrible has happened to spencer she rushes in only to find spencer and carols mother beverly connelly shirley knight pleasantly visiting with dr bettes dr bettes asks carol about what tests have been performed on spencer finding out that minimal emergency room tests have been doneno allergy tests for example dr bettes orders some tests for spencer and tells the lab he wants the results later that day one of the adults asks incredulously do you really expect the results today dr bettes says yes he says he does not know now exactly what is wrong with spencer but he guarantees that spencer will be feeling a lot better from now on he gives carol his business card tells her it has his home phone number and tells her to phone him if she has any concerns carol is overwhelmed she assures dr bettes that she is extremely grateful and will do everything she can do to pay for his services dr bettes tells her that melvin will be paying all the bills carol is shockedthat night carol cannot get to sleep she is trying to understand everything that happened why would melvin spend a lot of money to help spencer get better of course we know the answermelvin desperately wants to return to his comfortable daily rituals and spending money he does not need is the most obvious solution but this thought does not enter carols head she finally concludes that the only rational reason a man she barely knows would spend that kind of money on her behalf is to have sex with herso carol runs out into the pouring rain clad only in a tshirt pants and shoes she grabs a bus and goes to melvins apartment she bangs on the door and waits well you know what pouring rain does to a womans tshirt at the last moment carol realizes it too as melvin opens the door she grabs the front of her tshirt striving for some degree of modesty she blurts out that she knows why melvin was spending all that money on her son but that it is not going to workshe will never never never have sex with himmelvin is flabbergasted the thought of having sex with carol had never entered his mind he was only concerned with returning to his comfortable daily routine carol leaves but now the thought has entered his mind and percolates theremeanwhile frank has recruited a young man from a small neerdowell gang as a model for simon the young man thinks he is going to pose nude and starts shedding his clothes simon stops him after modeling some natural poses simon finds one he likes and proceeds to sketch himthey fall into a daily routine the young man comes over poses and simon sketches or paints him always fully clothed after a few weeks while simon is painting a portrait of the young man the young mans gang sneaks into the apartment and starts stealing things verdell alerts to them and simon confronts the intruders the gang brutally beat simon with things such as a table lampsimon winds up in the hospital he is severely injured his face looks like the face of frankenstein monster frank has to find a dogsitter for verdell so he tries the neighbors finally frank remembers that melvin owes him one and persuades melvin to take verdellsurprisingly verdell takes a liking to melvin and melvin responds by feeding verdell bacon and other treats when melvin goes out walking he is very careful to never step on a crack eventually verdell follows suit deliberately hopping over cracks melvin is thrilled they settle into a routine where melvin works on his computer while verdell keeps him company on a cushion next to him as well as walking the dog to breakfast this is such a comfortable routine for melvin that he quickly finishes is sixthsixth book life is going great for melvinafter a few weeks simon comes home from the hospital and insists on taking verdell back melvin is heartbroken but is cheered up when simon asks melvin to take verdell for a daily walkit turns out simon has no medical insurance he has to spend all his money on hospital bills his exhibition was a flop he has no income he cannot bring himself to resume working he is very depressed he has a list of friends he calls on for a loan but they all turn him down his last resort is to ask his estranged parents for money but they never answer the phone and live far away near baltimorefrank approaches melvin asking melvin to drive simon to baltimore while frank stays and cares for verdell simon resists but eventually simon succumbs perhaps figuring that if simon loses his apartment then simon and verdell will move away and melvin will no longer see his newfound friend verdell frank offers his convertible for the drivemelvin is too uncomfortable to go on that trip by himself so he grabs some comfortable familiarity by convincing carol to go with them staying in separate rooms using the leverage that since he helped spencer carol should help him carol reluctantly gives inthe three of them leave on the road trip they finally arrive near baltimore late in the evening and check into their hotel into a threebedroom suite carol phones home she finds out that spencer had played in his first soccer game and had scored his first goal carol is thrilled she wants to celebrate with someone she tries to get simon to go out with her but he firmly refuses so carol informs melvin that he is her datewhile melvin takes a shower carol quickly gets dressed in a pretty red dress with small white polka dots carol waits for melvin to get out of the shower and waits and waits and waits after a long time melvin finishes and actually looks rather spiffythey go off to a nice restaurant unfortunately the maitre d insists that melvin wear a suitcoat and tie but reassures him that he has some he is willing to lend to melvin he brings one out melvin is skeptical carol says you dry clean those each time right the maitre d says no that does it for melvin after seating carol he runs to a nearby haberdashery buys a suitcoat and tie and comes running backas they are being seated melvin complains that he has to wear a suitcoat and tie while they let carol in with an ordinary housedress carol is very offended she insists that melvin sincerely apologize or she will leave melvin says he is sorry carol says that the way to make that sincere is to pay her a sincere compliment this is clearly a struggle for melvin as he so rarely thinks positively about anyone eventually he says that when he is with her she makes him want to be a better man she is very flattered this is the best compliment she has ever received she becomes very attentive moves over right next to him within kissing range and asks him why he really wanted her to come on the trip she obviously hopes for some romantic reason instead he mumbles and fumbles and finally says that one reason was he hoped she would have sex with simon she is furious she immediately leaves him at the restaurantcarol goes back to the hotel she walks into simons roomthe one with a big bathtuband informs him she is going to take a bath even though simon is sitting there in the room she draws the water gets undressed out of sight wraps herself with a large towel and comes back in sight sitting on the bathtub with her back to simonas carol is putting her hair up she reaches a pose that simon thinks is amazing he tells her to hold the pose at first reticent she eventually loosens up starting by dropping her towel a bit so simon can see most of her bare backhours later melvin comes back to the suite to find carol lying naked on the bed with simon drawing sketch after sketch of her jealous perhaps a new experience for him melvin asks if she had sex with simon carol says no it was better than sex he held mewith his artistic spirit back simon is no longer depressed he loves life he phones his parents andmiracle of miraclesactually gets through he tells his mother he is doing fine would like to reconnect with them but it does not have to be now he hangs up happy he knows he might lose his apartment but he is sure he will be able to copethey all go back to new york while he was gone he has lost his apartment it turns out melvin had told the landlord to move all of simons things into melvins spare bedroom simon comes and looks at the room and is stupified both by how nice it is and by melvins willingness to let simon live there which we know is because melvin wants verdell aroundsimon talks melvin into going after carol melvin goes over to her apartment and approaches her in his usual fumbling way carol resists saying all she wants is a normal boyfriend carols mother who has been listening comes out and says thats what we all want but it never happens no one has a normal boyfriend just be happy with him as a boyfriend or words to that effect carol reconsiders and melvin continues with carol even to the point of stepping on cracks to be with hermissing abovewhere melvin bursts into the office of his psychiatrist dr green lawrence kasdan insists on an immediate appointment but is rebuffed he also got annoyed when he noticed the doctors office was changed but seeing as how he hadnt seen the doctor in years its understandablewhere carol writes a 10page missive thanking melvin for the help he has given spencer and insists on reading it to melvin while he is eating is breakfast at the cafe of course melvin just wants carol to stop disrupting his breakfast ritual and just go awayhere are some of melvins obsessive compulsive behaviors not mentioned abovehe washes his hands by opening a new bar of soap washing his hands with it once and throwing the nearlynew bar awayhe puts his shoes on by sitting on the bed and performing a backandforth dance around his shoes firstcoming into a room he sometimes locks and unlocks of the door several timesnote i only saw the movie once and just enjoyed it rather than taking
