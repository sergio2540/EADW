renee spei steve teamkin lynn wanlass charlie weirauch jack stanton is running for president the election is seen through the eyes of young henry burton along the way stanton must deal with a sex scandal this work is the barely fictionalized account of candidate bill clinton in 1992 via the character southern governor jack stanton joe klein joined newsweek as a political reporter and columnist during the 1992 us presidential race and followed then candidate bill clinton on the road as such klein dutifully conveys the youthful exuberance for a new candidate along with the sense of awe at his determination drive and intelligence all along he also displays the shocking lack of personal morals of a natural candidate for the office further he shows the inner dealmaking that everyone connected with the campaign makes to achieve the vision they started with no matter how ugly the cheating talented candidate gets on his road to the election klein tells the story from the 1st person perspective of a sophomorish campaign manager henry burton that just happens to be a grandson of a black civil rights leader they join the southern governor at a talk given on adult education in which gov stanton cries as he tells the students how they were braver than his unclea world war ii veteran that earned the medal of honor but went home and never took a job because he was too embarrassed to tell anyone he was illiterate we next find out this story is not true despite this burton decides to join the campaign and works many of the standard issuessuch as fighting off scurrilous attacks by opposing candidates and captured and doctored cell phone conversations etc burton walks into the campaign headquarters a hotel suite to find the governor coming out of a bedroom not completely dressed and a disheveled librarian they had just met at a school they had attended of course susan stanton the governors wife is nowhere to be found the team flies to another destination to meet up with mrs stanton as she has been campaigning for her husband among their party elite in that state burton is eventually introduced to libby holden whose job is to defend the president by combating the attacks from all comers she does so with ruthless abandon but also with a strict moral code there apparently is something noble about stopping the attacks of others but it is almost reprehensible about digging up the dirt on others  essentially attacking them first we come to know that gov stanton is a philanderer of extraordinary magnitude but an inspired genius at politics unfortunately this extends to sleeping with a 17yearold babysitter the librarian they just recently met a longterm affair with another woman and the list goes on well acted drama adapted from a novel by joe klein has a terrific first half and then falters horribly in the final half hour almost completely killing the entire movie travolta is deadon as southern governor jack stanton a thinly veiled charicature of bill clinton who is running for president the film is shown from the perspective of a young africanamerican man named henry burton who is stantons campaign manager through his eyes we spend intimate moments with the candidate his wife and family and the various people working on his campaign we also meet the other contenders for the office and get a rare inside glimpse of politics at work which can be a ruthless and conniving game its fascinating material and the film hits the ground running using a mostly good natured humorous approach the campaign must deal with the various and not unusual attacks by the opponents and must constantly dream up new strategies and schemes billy bob thornton is the man in charge of that department and he is all aces as richard jemmons a ruthless foul mouthed pr man when even he cant refute some of the attacks on stantons character like an alleged affair with a hairdresser mrs stanton turns to libby holden a terrific kathy bates libbys a quirky and unstable shes been recently released from a mental hospital defender of the governor whos reckless tactics actually get results but she has a strict moral code that none of the others operate by she will only go so far and while she will defend attacks from other candidates she refuses to dig up dirt to attack another candidate first it turns out that governor stanton is a genius player of the political game but also a tremendous philanderer who just may have had an affair with a 17 year old africanamerican girl and gotten her pregnant through some slick manipulation he is able to disprove this then one of his opponents suffers a paralyzing series of heart attacks and is out of the race only to be replaced by a seemingly impeccable dogooder it turns out that he has a past history of drug abuse and homosexuality the breaking of this news could seal the deal for stanton but libby is adament that he not go through with it this is where the film breaks down in a show of heavy handed moralizing and then a melodrmatic suicide that throws everything off course the film has an open ending never telling us flat out that stanton wins and goes on to become president of the united states but the answer isnt difficult to surmise this really is a good movie enriched with great performances from a terrific cast and plenty of inspired moments of wit and outrageousness it also has some heartening moments as well and these are a constant reminder of how and why bill clinton got elected in the first place nichols does a fine job of directing and elaine may does a pretty faithful adaptation of kleins novel though his story is fictional it is really a thinly disguised look at the 1992 presidential campaign of bill clinton klein worked for newsweek as a reporter and columnist during the 1992 presidential election and also followed clinton on the road and got to see a lot of things first hand youll see them in the movie and although most of it isnt that shocking if you think about it some of it really is or at least should be this film does make you think and it raises some pretty frightening conclusions after all that we do see going on imagine what we dont see behind the scenes and probably never will all of the wheeling and dealing and manipulation that is politics as usual fascinating even though not entirely successful 6.7candidate governor president
