coles carl toop john lees fifty seven years after ellen ripley survived her disastrous ordeal her escape vessel is recovered after drifting across the galaxy as she slept in cryogenic stasis back on earth nobody believed her story about the aliens on the planet lv426 after the company orders the colony on lv426 to investigate however all communication with the colony is lost the company enlists ripley to aid a team of tough rugged space marines on a rescue mission to the now partially terraformed planet to find out if there are aliens or survivors as the mission unfolds ripley will be forced to come to grips with her worst nightmare but even as she does she finds that the worst is yet to come the only survivor of the nostromo ripley is discovered in deep sleep half a century later by a salvage ship when she is taken back to earth she learns that a human colony was founded on the same planet where the aliens were first found after contact with the colony is lost she finds herself sent back to the planet along with a team of warriors bent on destroying the alien menace forever and saving any survivors  if any remain ellen ripley the sole survivor of the alien attack on the mining ship nostromo awakens half a century later when she is found by a salvage ship the welcome given to her by the company officials is far from warm since they refuse to believe her discovery of alien existence and strip her off her flight officers license ripley also discovers much to her horror that the planet lv426 where her crew had encountered an alien species for the first time is now colonized by the company but when all contact from the planet is lost ripley is called back into action again as an advisor to a team of tough space marines with lots of firepower to get rid of her recurrent nightmares about the alien creature ripley prepares for a final battle with the monsters  and this time there are hundreds of them out there the sequel to alien is a nonstop hightech war movie with space marines ripley is found in deep space by a salvage ship 57 years after narrowly escaping with her life  and her cat  at the end of alien she then discovers the company have colonised the planet where the alien was first encountered when contact with the colony is lost the company send a team of space marines with ripley as an advisor to find out what has happened 57 years after her ordeal with an extraterrestrial creature ellen ripley is rescued by a deep salvage team during her hypersleep when she discovers that transmissions from a colony that has since settled on the alien planet suddenly stop ripley is offered a chance to team up with a group of marines to descend on the planet and investigate the alien presence determined to end the memories of the alien creature ripley agrees to the offer and is once again thrown back into her living nightmare scenes in red are only in the special editionafter the opening credits we see a spacecraft drifting slowly through space inside is ripley sigourney weaver the only survivor from the previous film having escaped in the shuttle of the cargo ship nostromo which she blew up after an aggressive and hostile alien species was responsible for killing her colleagues ripley is still in cryogenic sleep with jones the crews pet cat lying on top of her a proximity alert goes off the lifeboat is intercepted by a salvage vessel the crew uses a welding torch to open the door and enters finding that ripley is still alivein gateway station a space facility orbiting earth ripley regains consciousness in a hospital a nurse tells her she is in a medical bay she is visited by carter burke paul reiser a representative of weylandyutani the company from the previous film and ripleys employer who brings jones the cat along when ripley states that she does not recognize the medical bay burke gives her some terrible news she has been in hypersleep for 57 years her ship having drifted aimlessly through space until the salvage vessel discovered it by very fortunate coincidence ripley shows clear distress and discomfort when jones starts hissing at her as she starts to convulse in the bed burke calls for medical attention and the staff try to restrain ripley she pleads with them to kill her before pulling her shirt up to reveal something pushing out of her stomach ripley suddenly wakes up boltupright in the hospital bed clutching her chest revealing the scene to be a nightmare a nurse on the monitor next to her bed asks her if she needs something to help her sleep but ripley declines the nurse was the one featured in her dream the dream was a recollection from a real encounter with burke apart from the alien bursting outsome time later ripley is sitting in an simulated environment waiting for burke who wants to prepare her for a board hearing the company has started a formal investigation into what happened with the nostromo and wants to question ripley about her role in its destruction ripley is only interested in news about her daughter burke hesitantly hands her a picture of an old woman and tells a devastated ripley that her daughter only a child when ripley left with the nostromo has passed away from cancer while she was drifting through spaceduring the inquiry ripley desperately tries to convince the board of the dangerous nature of the alien and the potential threat of the derelict ship which still contains hundreds of eggs she explains that company policies at the time gave the nostromo crew orders to obtain the creature which killed the crew and caused the destruction of the ship however the board is extremely sceptical of ripleys testimony because she admits to having destroyed the nostromo and evidence of the alien creature is lacking they treat her as if she is mentally unstable the board does not press criminal charges but revokes her flight license and submits her to psychiatric supervision upon asking why no one will go to the planetoid to confirm her story ripley is shocked to learn that the planetoid now known as lv426 has already been colonized by terraformers for 30 years who are creating an atmosphere to make the air breathable and the planetoid habitablesome time thereafter at the colony headquarters on lv426 two company employees discuss recently received company orders to investigate a certain unsurveyed part of the surface of the planetoid a surveyor is currently doing the job wondering if he can make a claim to anything he finds the higherranking man complains how they never got an answer to the question why those particular coordinates were so interesting but assures that anything found can be claimed outside on the barren and stormy planet surface the aforementioned surveyor together with his wife son timmy and daughter rebecca whom is called newt carrie henn discovers the same derelict ship previously found by ripleys crew in alien he and his wife go in to investigate but after a very long while the wife comes back and calls for help on the radio her husband is lying on the ground with a creature attached to his face a facehugger like the one that attacked kane in alienreleased on her own recognizance ripley gets an apartment at gateway station some time later she is visited by burke who is accompanied by lt gorman william hope of the colonial marines burke tells ripley that contact with the colony on lv426 has suddenly been lost fearing that aliens are responsible the company intends to send a squadron of marines they would like her to act as an adviser as she has personal experience with this species burke will come along as the company cofinanced the colony burke is aware that ripley has taken a job on gateway station running loaders and forklifts work that is clearly beneath her as a further incentive weylandyutani has agreed to reinstate ripley as a warrant officer if she goes ripley refuses as she dreads going back to the place where she first encountered the alien and because she is still frustrated that nobody at the company believed her earlier story but as her nightmares continue she feels that if she does not go on the mission she will never find any peace she calls burke and when he assures her that the mission to lv426 is to eradicate any aliens not to study or capture them she gives in jones will stay on the stationa marine ship the sulaco travels through deep space inside are colonial marines led by gorman accompanied by ripley and burke after awakening from hypersleep seasoned veteran sergeant apone al matthews quickly takes command ripley discovers that the marines are a mostly undisciplined lot who are not taking the alien threat seriously at all one tough female marine named vasquez jeanette goldstein refers to ripley as snow white and the soldiers seem to have a low opinion of their inexperienced ranking officer gorman who shows little interest in getting to know his squad members ripley is also dismayed to learn that an android named bishop lance henriksen has accompanied them on the mission as their science officer she mistrusts androids ever since her altercations with ash from the previous movie and she has an angry confrontation with bishop when he tries to befriend heras the sulaco approaches lv426 ripley tells the marines about her experiences with the aliens dubbed xenomorphs by gorman during a mission brief but they are still rather undisciplined and scoff at the possible threat the creatures pose during weapons detail ripley gradually begins to impress the soldiers offering to help them load their dropship and displaying her expertise with the large power loader a hydraulically enhanced suit cpl hicks michael biehn takes a special interest in ripley impressed with her strong personality and her way with peopletaking the drop ship from the sulaco to the planet gorman confesses that he has hardly any experience with these kind of missions further undermining the opinion the marines have for him one of the soldiers private hudson bill paxton is loudly boasting his courage and the supreme firepower that they have at their disposal the dropship flies over the colony which is a gigantic manmade structure but without any visible activity burke explains that the facility is an atmosphere processor designed to make planets suitable for human life and that weylandyutani manufactures them the ship lands and deploys an armoured personal carrier apc with the marines inside before taking off again the marines exit the apc and enter the main colony complex they sweep the building with motion trackers but find the building deserted save for a few laboratory mice left behind inside the soldiers discover evidence of a battle including several barricades hits from small arms and acidburns on the ground but conclude the building is safe for now which ripley doesnt believe gorman burke and ripley enter the building but ripley is visibly affected by bad memories in the medical lab they finally happen upon evidence of ripleys story in a series of stasis tubes they find several facehugger organisms the life stage of the alien creature that attaches itself to the face of a host two of them appear to be still alive bishop finds a file describing an attempt to remove a facehugger from one of its victims before it could implant an alien embryo the removal resulted in the death of the subject ripley and the others make an even more startling discovery a little girl about eleven years old has survived the alien assault on the colony she runs away under the floor grating at the sight of the marines but ripley succeeds in winning her trust initially the girl is noncommunicative seemingly in shock but ripley eventually gets through to her newt is the daughter of the surveyor family as seen in a scene at the beginning of the special edition newt tells ripley that her parents and the others are dead all victims of the aliens and that shed feel safer if she could return to her hiding place in the ventilation system ripley assures her that shell be safer with herself and the marinesthe cocky pvt hudson tracks the colonists by using homing devices embedded in their skin and discovers that the entire population seems to be crowded underneath the primary heat exchangers of the facility the team take the apc to the atmosphere processor where apone and the marines get out and gorman  burke remain aboard with newt and ripley to coordinate the sweep from a distance while descending the facility the marines discover strange organic hivelike structures that must have been secreted by the aliens ripley realizes that the marines are walking next to the colonys nuclear reactor and that their projectile weapons could do serious damage to it that could cause it to explode gorman orders them to hand in their highcaliber ammunition however both vasquez and drake secretly reactivate their smartguns using spare connectors vasquez had hidden in her equipment as the team enters the basement they find an alien hive containing the dead bodies of the colonists cocooned as hosts for the alien facehugger parasites one colonist is still alive but she starts to convulse upon awakening and an infant alien a chestburster bursts its way out of her chest the marines kill it with a flame thrower but the sudden stir awakens the dormant warrior aliens which are concealed inside the walls which offer them effective camouflage they begin to attack causing one marine to misfire her flamethrower causing an explosion of an ammunition stash the resulting disorientation proves disastrous as the marines have no idea where the attackers are coming from and are quickly reduced in their numbers the marines start firing back some with the restricted ammo but the chaos and noise make it hard for anyone especially lt gorman and sgt apone to focus and organize a coordinated defense apone is suddenly attacked and incapacitated causing an unprepared gorman to panic ripley angered and frantic at gormans lack of control takes control over gormans protests driving the apc all the way through the service ramps into the nest to rescue the surviving marines only four make it back to the apc and one drake is killed by acid from an exploding alien shot by vasquez ripley recovers vasquez hicks and hudson hicks manages to kill an alien that tries to enter the apc with a shotgun blast which results in a large acid burn on hudsons arm gorman is knocked unconscious while ripley drives the apc out of the facility crushing an alien under the wheels along the way and driving straight through a closed metal door the escape destroys the apcs driving axle rendering the vehicle largely immobileon the planet surface in the apc the survivors discover that several of their missing colleagues are still displaying life signs on the monitor ripley assures them nothing can be done as they are being cocooned like the colonists to be hosts for more facehuggers and chestbursters vasquez recommends they nerve gas the area but they opt against it as there is no guarantee that the aliens are even susceptible hudson has lost his nerve and expresses only cowardice and panic ripley suggests taking off and nuking the site from orbit but burke protests as he is concerned about the dollar value of the facility they can bill me ripley replies burke continues to protest citing the importance of the alien species and claiming that no one has the right to arbitrarily exterminate them ripley vasquez  hudson angrily denounce burkes defense of the creatures and it appears that weylandyutani is still intending to try to get an alien for the weapons division similar to what it had ordered ash to do in alien cpl hicks who is now in command seconds ripleys motion and summons the pilots of the dropship however an alien that has slipped on board kills the pilot in midflight and the ship crashes as the rest of the marines barely flee the crash site part of the dropship collides with the apc destroying it and most of the teams weaponryripley and the others are now stranded on the planet surface with no immediate means of returning to the sulaco and hudson is starting to annoy the group with his incessant complaints newt warns them that they should take cover because the aliens come out usually at night they retreat back into the main colony complex where bishop treats gorman and the rest surveys the limited remaining weapon arsenal they were able to salvage from the apc wreckage amongst the items are four sentry guns remote operated machine guns that can target automatically hudson panics again upon hearing that a rescue team can be expected no earlier than 17 days but ripley finally reprimands him and points out that newt has survived an even longer period without weapons or training the survivors decide to fortify the barricades and seal off all possible access routes for the aliens into the main colony complex the plan is quickly brought into action and even hudson shows some determination again the sentry guns are placed at strategic locations where the aliens are expected to try and enter the building a test shows that they function optimallyhicks consolidates ripleys trust by giving her a small locator to wear on her wrist so he can find her anywhere inside the complex ripley puts newt to bed newt wonders about what happened to her mother  especially if one of the aliens came from inside her mother  but ripley cant give her the answer she tells newt about her own daughter who has also died newt is scared to go to sleep so ripley puts her locator on newt and assures her she can find her anywhere in the complex nowthe group is discussing the aliens and their way of reproduction humans are used as hosts for the facehuggers which come from eggs but who or what produces these eggs hudson proposes a large dominant female a queen such as in a social insect colony ripley orders bishop to destroy the two remaining facehuggers but he tells her he got specific orders from burke to keep them alive ripley confronts burke about it he wants the specimens taken back to earth because the weapons industry will pay large amounts of money for them he even tries to enlist her help in smuggling them past quarantine ripley refuses moreover she has checked the colony log and learned that burke was responsible for sending the colonists to the derelict ship after he learned about its existence from ripley during her trial ripley blames burke for not warning the colonists about the danger but burke puts it aside as a simple error in judgment this enrages ripley and grabbing him by the lapels she angrily vows to expose burkes treachery when they return to earthas ripley exits the room the alarm sounds the aliens have arrived at the first set of sentry guns inside the access tunnel the guns kill many of them but they quickly run out of ammo as the aliens numbers are vastly superior however they stop their advance just as the guns run out of ammo  bishop calls in that there is another problem the nuclear reactor at the terraforming tower has started to vent air they learn that damage to the structure has caused it to malfunction the cooling units have failed and the core will explode within hours damage from the crash has made it impossible to shut down the reactor remotely calling the second dropship from the sulaco is also impossible as the hardware to control the satellite no longer works the only option is to go to the uplink tower and manually remotepilot the sulacos second dropship to the surface hudson relapses into his desperation act again refusing to go however bishop unexpectedly offers to crawl through a small conduit to the uplink tower as he is the only one qualified to pilot the ship anywaythe second set of sentry guns empties its ammo into the hoard of aliens a great many creatures advance on the unmanned guns but eventually relent not realizing that they have almost run out of ammunition hicks promises ripley he will not let her die by the aliens preferring to kill them both rather than falling victim to the creatures he then gives her a crash course in how to use a pulse rifle and there appears to be a subtle attraction between them on her way back to newt ripley passes by gorman who has regained consciousness and is clearly embarrassed by his earlier conduct she proceeds to newt and finds her curled up asleep hiding underneath the bed instead of waking her ripley joins her underneath for a nap laying her pulse rifle on the bed for safe keepingmeanwhile bishop has crawled through the narrow conduit and reached the uplink tower and is preparing the other dropship for departure he communicates directly with hicks and his crewripley wakes up to find two empty stasis tubes on the ground the two facehuggers have escaped they are locked inside the lab and the pulse rifle has been taken ripley and newt are attacked by a scurrying facehugger but ripley fends it off and tries to signal the marines through a surveillance camera however burke slyly turns off the monitor to prevent the others from seeing it ripley manages to trigger the fire alarm with her cigarette lighter but this also draws out the facehuggers hicks hudson gorman and vasquez arrive just as a facehugger attempts to attach itself to ripleys face and the second one threatens newt the facehugger threatening newt is killed immediately by hudson hicks  gorman get the 2nd facehugger off ripley and throw it into a corner where vasquez kills it with a pulserifle as it tries to attack again ripley knows it must be burke who was acting in retaliation in the comm room ripley suggests that burke intended to impregnate her and newt with the facehuggers then sabotage the other marines cryotubes so as to eliminate any witnesses he would emerge back at earth as the only survivor and smuggle the aliens in the bodies of ripley and newtburke denies ripleys allegations but the other marines are quickly convinced by ripleys story as they debate what they should do with burke which includes executing him the power to the facility is suddenly cut off hicks has vasquez and hudson walk perimeter they use motion trackers and register movement coming towards them everyone pulls back in the central operations room but the signal keeps approaching even beyond the barricades they suddenly realize that they have blocked the direct access routes but forgotten the less obvious ways in hicks opens a ceiling panel and sees that the army of aliens has simply circumvented the barricades by climbing through the crawlspace over the ceiling as the remaining marines take on the aliens burke slips away and prevents their escape by sealing the med lab door however he is attacked  killed by an alien that has already found a way inside the med lab newt finds an alternate escape through the air ducts hudson puts up a brave fight gunning down several aliens but he is ambushed by several aliens coming up from the floor grid who grab and haul him away once inside the vent vasquez is attacked by an alien coming down through a vertical duct she manages to shoot it with a handgun but the spilling acidic blood of the creature seriously wounds her leg gorman comes to help her but they suddenly find themselves surrounded by aliens gorman and vasquez sacrifice themselves by triggering a grenade together which decimates the pursuing aliens the explosion causes newt to fall through a ventilation shaft that leads to the bottom of the facility ripley and hicks take the stairs to the basement they find newt in a sewer below a grid which hicks tries to weld open but newt is snatched by an alien before they can rescue her ripley screams in desperation but remains determined to rescue newt knowing the aliens will cocoon her to await a facehugger she and hicks take the elevator up but an alien jumps in before the doors close hicks kills the creature but is severely wounded by the aliens corrosive blood which quickly eats through his body armor ripley drags hicks out through the complex main doors and they meet up on the surface with bishop who has just piloted the rescue ship to the surface by remote ripley however refuses to leave the planet and demands that bishop take her back to the atmosphere processor to rescue newtbishop reluctantly flies the dropship into the atmosphere processor which is now beginning to overload and lands on a high platform ripley arms herself with a pulse rifle and a flame thrower ignoring bishops warnings that the explosion is imminent she says goodbye to the wounded hicks who as a sign of trust tells her his name is dwayne ripley tells him she is called ellen ripley takes an elevator down enters the basement and leaves signal flares on the ground for backtracking as she infiltrates the alien hive she uses the locator signal to find newt but only finds the detached locator she collapses to the floor struck with grief but hears newt scream the girl has been cocooned and is threatened by a facehugger hatching from an egg ripley kills the creature which alerts a warrior alien to her presence the attacking warrior is quickly gunned down by ripley and she frees newt from the cocoonwall several explosions from the failing reactor drive ripley  newt back into the egg chamber that houses a monstrous alien the queen of the hive several warrior aliens close in on them but when ripley threatens to destroy the eggs the warrior aliens retreat ripley  newt slowly back out of the egg chamber planning to leave the queen and eggs to be destroyed in the imminent nuclear explosion but when an egg hatches next to ripley she can stand it no longer she turns the flamethrower on the eggs spraying the room with napalm the queen goes mad screeching insanely at the destruction of her offspring warrior aliens begin attacking and ripley quickly guns them down with the pulserifle she then fires a series of grenades into the queens eggsac blowing it to bits as they retreat out of the chamber a warrior alien ambushes them but he is quickly gunned down ripley throws the grenade belt into the raging inferno and then retreats towards the elevator the exploding grenades destroy the remaining eggs  warrior aliens but also dislodge the queen alien from her perch the queen tears herself free from the eggsac and furiously pursues ripley and newt who just make it back to the elevator as they retreat into the elevator they are cornered by the queen and ripley uses the remaining napalm in the flamethrower on the queen burning her severely as they arrive on the platform they find that the dropship has left already while the surrounding complex is quickly exploding and collapsing another elevator door opens and the queen comes out ripley intends to leap to their deaths rather than let the queen kill them but just then the dropship comes hovering over the platform and ripley and newt are narrowly able to get on safely and on time the dropship carrying ripley newt bishop and hicks barely escapes as the processing facility explodes in a massive mushroom cloudback on the sulaco bishop says he had to sedate hicks for the pain he explains that he had to take off from the platform which became unstable and had to circle while waiting to pick them up ripley makes peace with bishop thanking him for saving their lives suddenly bishop is speared from behind by a huge stinger and ripped in half at the waist by the queen she has stowed away by hiding inside the recess for the landing gear she advances menacingly towards ripley and newt and they scatter newt dives under the flooring but the queen starts ripping it up until she has the child cornered suddenly ripley appears inside the large forklift powerloader the exoskeletonlike machine makes her an even match for the giant queen and they battle furiously ripley punches the queen several times grabs her and attempts to dump her into the ships airlock but the queen quickly grabs hold of the powerloader and ripley gets dragged down into the air lock with her ripley manages to get out and climb up the ladder as the queen grabs her leg she activates the controls opening the outer lock door causing air to rush out of the ship the queen desperately tries to hold on to ripleys leg but she suddenly loses her grip and is shot out into deep space screaming madly ripley somehow manages to pull herself up out of the air lock against the enormous air pressure and closes the airlock newt comes up to her and hugs her calling her mommy bishop now only an upper torso congratulates her not bad for a human as ripley and newt hugthe film ends as ripley prepares newt hicks and whats left of bishop for hypersleep for the journey back to earth she assures newt she can sleep all the way and that they both can dream they are both in deep sleep as the credits roll 8.5alien
