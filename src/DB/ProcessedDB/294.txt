actually and magicaly comes truefletcher through a series of embarrassing incidents finds that he is unable to lie mislead or even withhold a true answer he blurts out exactly what he is thinking like a torrettes syndrome twitch and figures out that he is unable to lie or even withhold a true answer some of these instances include immediately after max makes his wish fletcher has just had sex with miranda and when she asks was it good for you ive had better he respondsthe plot is reminiscent of the twilight zone episode the whole truth which involves a used car salesman being forced into uninhibited honesty by a haunted carthe next morning when an attractive girl says everyone is so nice to her he says well thats because you have big jugs i mean your boobs are huge i mean i wanna squeeze emalso when he walks out of the elevator at his office and everyone is plugging their nose he admits it was me when an obese man asks whats up he says your cholesterol dead man walkin he also tells a coworker he doesnt know his name because hes not important enough when he tries to explain his situation to his secretary greta anne haney she doesnt believe him so he sets himself up good he tells her to ask him something she thinks he would normally lie about greta asks him about a raise she wanted a couple months ago fletcher had told her if he gave her a raise it would make the other secretaries jealous she asks if that was true or if he just didnt want to pony up the dough greta immediately quits and threatens to sue himthese incidents are inconvenient as he is fighting a divorce

cannot even ask a question if he knows the answer will be a lie during the case he even objects to himself when he tries to lie to get the desired information meanwhile audrey is planning to move to boston with her new boyfriend jerry cary elwes and decides that max is going with them so that she can protect him from getting hurt by fletcher it is here that fletcher learns about maxs birthday wish and now realizes that he cannot tell a lie for 24 hours which will mean that the magical ability or curse will expire on the 24th hour when max made the wish at his birthday party at 815 pmfletcher tries desperately to delay the case even beating himself up but he cannot conceal that he is able to continue so judge marshall stevens jason bernard insists that he does finally he realizes that his client had lied about her age and therefore had signed her prenuptial agreement while a minor rendering it invalid this allows him to win his case truthfully but the repercussions become a catalyst to his understanding of what he himself is about to lose samantha who only cared about her exhusbands money takes custody of her children purely so her exhusband would be forced to continue paying her for child care and literally snatches the children out of the arms of their good and caring father fletcher then has a crisis of conscience and shouts at the judge to reverse the decision and is taken to jail for contempt of court audrey refuses to pay his bail which is eventually paid by his secretary greta anne haney who forgives him for his earlier rude truthtellings after hearing he went all noble in front of their firms senior partnernow recognizing his son max as his highest priority fletcher struggles to keep him he hurries to the airport but audrey and maxs plane
