barclay wright noah huntley robert jezek emily booth teresa may in the year 2047 a group of astronauts are sent to investigate and salvage the long lost starship event horizon the ship disappeared mysteriously 7 years before on its maiden voyage and with its return comes even more mystery as the crew of the lewis and clark discover the real truth behind its disappearance and something even more terrifying it is the year 2047 seven years have passed since the mysterious disappearance of event horizon a spaceship that was sent to explore the outer limits of our solar system now it is the time for a rescue mission that will find the ship and bring back the survivors if any in the year 2047 the search and rescue ship lewis and clark rushes to the event horizon an experimental ship which disappeared in deep space with all crew aboard unfortunately the ship has something on board which leads to horrific consequences the year is 2047 and a ship named the event horizon has reappeared after disappearing 7 years prior in experiments for faster than light travel a rescue hastily speeds to the returned vessel after a transmission was picked up from the ship garbled but vaguely resembling a human voice as the crew reach the ship and spend longer on it it appears that someone or something is toying with them and more the question is what has the event horizon become a rescue crew in space comes to investigate and if possible rescue a government spaceship gone missing for seven years when they board the ship they learn that the ship has been somewhere beyond space and brought something back with it that is an unspeakable evil in the year 2047 a signal from the starship event horizon is picked up on earth the ship had disappeared without trace beyond the planet neptune in 2040 her loss was considered the worst space disaster on record with her entire 18person crew missing and presumed dead the ship has since reappeared in a decaying orbit around neptune at the outer rim of the solar system and more than three billion kilometers from the nearest outpost on the saturn moon of titan the rescue ship lewis and clark is dispatched to investigate the ships crew is commanded by capt miller laurence fishburne and carries the event horizons designer dr william weir sam neillwhen the lewis and clark arrives the crew are informed by dr weir that the event horizon had actually been built by the government to test a secret experimental fasterthanlight gravity drive the drive would create an artificial black hole to bridge two points in space to significantly reduce journey time the ship had been on its initial test flight intended to reach proxima centauri it subsequently vanished without a trace weir plays to the crew the only signal received since the ships reappearance spoken by ships captain cpt kilpack which is a series of garbled and confusing screams and shouts embedded in which is the latin phrase liberate me save meupon approaching the drifting vessel no definitive trace of human life is found inconclusive sensor readings lead the lewis and clarks crew to enter the event horizon to search for survivors inside the crew split up and medical tech peters kathleen quinlan discovers a frozen human corpse floating on the bridge with both eyes gouged out engineer justin jack noseworthy enters the ships core and sees a black liquidlike mirror within its drive it sucks him inside as he touches it and emits a large shock wave damaging the lewis and clark rescue tech cooper richard t jones manages to pull justin out of the core by his tether but he is catatonicwith the lewis and clark heavily damaged the remaining crew transfer to the event horizon which only contains 20 hours of usable oxygen a short time later justin emerges from his catatonia and attempts suicide by ejecting himself from an airlock without a space suit saying he is tormented by horrific images he saw inside the ships core although justin snaps out of his trance just in time to be rescued by miller but he is seriously injuredsoon afterwards the rescuers begin to experience hallucinations of their personal fears and regrets miller sees the manifestation of a subordinate he was forced to abandon in a fire peters sees images of her son denny barclay wright with his legs covered in bloody lesions and widower dr weir sees his wife claire holley chant missing her eyes and urging him to join herthe crew discovers that although the ships drive successfully opened a gateway in spacetime it actually led outside the known universe and into another dimension described as pure chaos pure evil the event horizons reconstructed video log shows the original crew activating the gravity drive and minutes later engaging in a frenzy of torture selfmutilation cannibalism and sodomy the ships captain who has torn out his own eyes leaves the previouslyheard latin message which has since been found to actually say liberate tutame ex inferis save yourself from hellit appears that the event horizon has returned with a supernatural presence which is using its occupants personal torments against them with the aim of compelling them to return to the chaos dimension the lewis and clark now repaired miller decides to destroy the event horizon despite the strong objections of weir while preparing to evacuate peters is led to her death by plummeting down a shaft as a result of being tricked by a manifestation of her son weir having abandoned the crew and arriving at the core discovers her body he sees a vision of his wifes suicide and is compelled by her reanimated form to tear out his eyesweir then uses bombs fitted to the event horizon to destroy the lewis and clark which kills its pilot smith sean pertwee and causes cooper on the ships hull to be thrown into space weir goes on to kill dj jason isaacs by vivisection leaving him suspended from the ceiling of the medical facilityseemingly possessed by the evil presence on board weir threatens the two survivors miller and xo starck joely richardson with a nail gun saying the ship is alive and will not allow anyone to leave he activates the ships gravity drive beginning a tenminute countdown after which the event horizon will return to the chaoshell dimension cooper having used his space suits oxygen to propel him back to the ship causes weir to shoot the bridge window and be blown into space towards his apparent death miller attempts to detonate the explosives installed on the event horizon to split the ship in two after arming all of the explosives and recovering the detonator for them he is trapped by a burning manifestation of his former comrade and forced to escape to the ships coreinside the core miller again sees the vision of his comrade which then changes into a scarred dr weir eyes restored who shows miller scenes of the lewis and clarks remaining crew being tortured and mutilated the two fight but miller is eventually able to reach the detonator which he then triggers sacrificing himself as the ship explodes weir screams denied the surviving crewthe ship explodes at the neck and splits in two the gravity drive then activates pulling the rear of the ship into a wormhole starck and cooper with a wounded and comatose justin survive in the remaining forward decks and place themselves into stasis for the return to earth starck has a nightmare of a mutilated dr weir rescuing her and is awakened in a distraught state by the real rescue team cooper restrains starck as one of the rescuers calls for a sedative the automated hatch leading to the stasis chamber seals shut behind the rescuers implying the supernatural force is inherent to the ship and not dependent on the gravity drivethe end 6.7black hole rescue
