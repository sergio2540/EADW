batterypowered transistor radio the sons satchel primarily containing his toys and a small piece of cloth they used as their picnic dropcloth while they walk through the outback sometimes looking as though near death they come across an australian boy who is on his walkabout a rite of passage into manhood where he spends months on end on his own living off the land their largest problem is not being able to verbally communicate the boy does help them to survive but doesnt understand their need to return to civilization which may or may not happen based on what the australian boy ends up doing somewhere in adelaide australia a family lives within a highrise apartment building where the mother is preparing a meal and listening to the radio her fourteen year old daughter jenny agutter and six year old son luc roeg swim in the buildings pool overlooking a view of the ocean while their father john meillon deep in troubled thought watches them from their balconyone day the father takes his children still in their school uniforms on a picnic into the outback he parks the car and reads while his daughter sets up a blanket with their lunch her brother plays nearby with his water gun and toy soldiers suddenly and for reasons unclear to his children the father announces it is time to go and brandishes a gun firing several shots at them the boy thinks it all to be a game but his sister understands the danger and shields her brother as they run from their mad father she watches in horror as her father returns to the car and sets it on fire before seating himself within and putting a bullet into his head quickly and keeping her brothers eyes averted the girl retrieves their radio a scarf and what food she can carry before setting off into the wilderness with her brotherthe siblings walk for hours under the hot sun calmed by irrelevant radio broadcasts and walking past a host of wild creatures come nightfall they make a crude camp for themselves much to the boys delight in the morning the girl leads them up a rocky hillside where she hopes to find some bearings however she can see nothing but a broad spanse of wilderness when they finish their lemonade the girl opens a can of vegetables from which they drink the juice recalling an uncles story of military training the girl suggests they eat salt to retain water and surmises to her brother that they may spend some time in the desert she remains stoic but wary while her brother is blissfully unaware of their situation remaining entertained by the radio and his toys eventually after becoming filthy and tired they come upon a lone tree standing over a pool of water where parakeets flock and feast on fallen fruit the boy puts on in his mouth and proclaims that it tastes lovely they wash in the water and the girl scolds her brother to take care of his clothes so they will last when he asks if they are lost the girl replies that they are not trying to remain chipper they sleep to the sounds of the radio as night animals stir around themin the morning the girl wakes to find that their water hole has dried up and the fruit has either been eaten or spoiled the girl decides to remain where they are hoping that the water will return as they nap in the hot sun the boy spots an aborigine youth david gulpilil pursuing an animal for food they make contact and the children attempt to communicate with the aborigine boy however he does not understand their language and merely stares at them with curiosity the girl repeats their need for water but the word is incomprehensible to the aborigine when her brother mimics drinking the aborigine understands and shows them how to dig for water using a hollow tube to drink through assuming that he will lead them to civilization the siblings accompany the aborigine unaware that he is on a walkabout a comingofage journey that every male aborigine youth must take alone in order to be initiated as an adult in his tribeas they travel the outback the aborigine kills and harvests food for them giving them all plenty to eat and drink the move from the desert to greener pastures and forests where wildlife becomes plentiful when the boy becomes sunburnt from going shirtless the aborigine rubs pig fat on his back to alleviate the burn while communication between them remains limited the trio share food and play together though cultural differences are evident the boy attempts to share his toy soldiers with the aborigine but he finds no use for them and tosses them aside despite their time together the aborigine and the girl develop a tension in part due to their sexual maturity while the girl remains wary and tries to keep her distance the aborigine develops feelings for her when he tries to talk to her she does not understand though her brother attempts to find meaning using pantomime the aborigine boy stops near a rock cliff and draws a story on the rock face the girl follows his lead and draws a house hoping the boy will understand he seems toaborigine workers and children surround a solitary house and trailer in the outback painted white with plaster from the figurines theyre making their boss a gruff white male overlooks their progress berating them at times while his wistful wife walks the property she comes upon the aborigine boy and speaks to him but he rebuffs the womans advances and walks away the woman spots the children the boy is with but they remain unaware of her presence and follow the aborigine further into the wildsso near and yet so far away less than a few miles from the childrens location a group of scientists fiddle with weather balloons though the men seem more interested in the solitary woman on their team they look over at her every time she leans and one man goes so far as to eliminate further competition for her affections by letting loose one of their balloons inciting a short chase by the other men the balloon drifts away and eventually is caught in brambles and found by the aborigine boy tired the girl asks him when they will reach their destination her brother translates the aborigines signs that they should arrive that daylater they come upon a homestead overlooking a field of green and backed by a forest the girl runs ahead along a picket fence but is upset to find that the home is deserted and crumbling they set up residence there and the aborigine boy tries to speak to the girl but does not understand her sorrow he watches her as she tours the home and begins to cry after finding some old photographs he remains confused but understand when the girl asks for water later on the aborigine shows the boy a paved road near the homestead before going hunting he chases an animal with his spear but is knocked aside as a truck carrying white men drives past and guns the animal down the boy watches in silent confusion as the men tote the animal awayhe returns to the homestead and ignores the girls hello his feelings culminating he decides to perform a courtship dance for the girl perhaps knowing that he can never return to his tribe he paints himself with white clay and puts feathers on his arms and head however his dance frightens the girl and she shuts herself inside the house with her brother while he continues to dance outside into the night despite his visibly exhaustion the girl refuses to speak to him when her brother tells her of the road that he found with the aborigine the girl decides that they will continue along their journey alone come morningthe next day they dress fully in their school uniforms and collect their things the boy looks for the aborigine who has disappeared but the girl insists that he went back to his people and that his absence is for the best her brother then tells her he tried to offer the aborigine his pen as a gift but the boy didnt take it puzzled the girl follows her brother to where the aborigine had propped himself in a hanging position in the low branches of a tree dead of exhaustion and heartbreak the girl swats a few ants off the boys body looks at him sadly and then takes her brother to the road they follow it to a row of buildings near a mine quarry and knock on one of the trailer doors an older man answers begrudgingly and tells them to leave when the girl begs for help he tells them where they can wait for someone to collect them the siblings walk away from the trailer and its well watered lawn to the old mine where they play together among scrap metalyears later a young man returns home where he greets his wife the girl now grown and tells her that hes been promoted to a position that will finance a vacation on the gold coast his wifes mind wanders and when he asks her what shes thinking of she replies nothing but we see her visions of years past when she and her brother bathed and played happily and without trifle needs in the outback with their aborigine friend 7.7australian-outback walkabout tribe photograph cliff
