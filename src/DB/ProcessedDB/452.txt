trying to bounce back from the financial troubles that suffered after becoming known as the site of shark attacks four years earlier mayor larry vaughn is welcoming developer len peterson and his new resort to amity two scuba divers are exploring the area where the orca sank after police chief martin brody killed a huge shark four years ago a shark shows up and devoured the two divers but not before one of the divers takes a closeup picture of the sharks eye and sometime later while a mother is driving a boat thats pulling her waterskiing teenage daughter the shark devours the daughter and causes the mother to accidentally blow up the boat then a killer whale is found on the shore with a huge bites on it after brody sees this he knows theres another huge great white shark in amitys waters but vaughn and peterson explain these attacks away as nonshark accidents because the thought of another shark in amitys waters would drive tourists away from the new resort and cause the new resort to lose money it looks like vaughn is still a mayor who puts money ahead of peoples lives brody tips his guns hollow point bullets with cyanide and melted candle wax and tells his sons michael and sean to stay away from the beaches and told them to not go sailing with mikes friends who include vaughns son larry vaughn jr everyone thinks brodys fears are shark traumainduced paranoia brody even tries to call his friend matt hooper who is doing research on a boat in the antarctic circle and matt will be in the antarctic circle for a few more months while keeping an eye on the waters from the beachs shark tower brody sees a huge dark spot in the water and rings the towers alarm bell but it turns out to be a school of bluefish vaughn fires brody for causing this panic at the beach and scaring tourists and their money away and even though they were told not to michael and sean go out sailing with junior vaughn and their friends unaware that the shark is trailing them brody knows its up to him to find them before its too late four years after the events of the original jaws the town of amity suddenly experiences series of mysterious boating accidents and disappearances chief of police martin brody fears that another shark is out there but he is ignored by the townsfolk unfortunately hes right there is another great white in the sea and it wants revenge the chief of police of amity island must contend again with a maneating great white shark when a group of boating teenagers including his son are attacked four years after having to contend with a killer great white shark a series of boating accidents and mysterious incidents convince the chief of police of amity island that another great white had appeared in the vicinity unfortunately he is unable to obtain proof and the island officials refuse to believe the threat exists while various swimmers and boating enthusiasts carry on regardless it is 4 years after the events of jaws and the residents of amity are putting their lives back together with the opening of a new hotel  luxury condominiums two divers also come across the wreck of quints boat orca and start taking photographs a huge shark appears and devoured the divers but not before one of them got a picture of it when the camera is found later police chief brody decided to develop the film while waiting for the results a young waterskier is attacked and killed by the shark who then attacks the tow boat blowing it up  killing the driver a killer whale carcass is also found on shore with huge bites taken out of it which convinces the chief that a great white shark is back in the water of amity later brody spots the shark from the shark tower at the beach and orders it evacuated but it turns out to be a school of bluefish the film is developed that night and brody has the proof he needs  the photo of the head of a shark when he presents it to the town council they simply deny that its a shark brody is fired by the council with only mayor vaughan opposed next day the shark ambushes a group of lobster divers and then heads after a group of kids in sailboats  including brodys and vaughans sons the shark cripples the boats and kills 2 more people as brody starts a search on the police launch will he be able to locate them before the shark gets to them two divers are photographing the wreck of the orca quints boat from the first film and are suddenly attacked and killed by a large great white shark but not before one of the divers camera gets a photo of the sharks eye the shark later prowls the coastal waters of amity island killing a female water skier the female driver of the speedboat tries to defend herself by first throwing a gasoline tank at the shark accidentally spilling some on herself and then igniting the fuel with a flare gun the fire ignites the gas tank and the speedboat explodes killing the driver and leaving the shark heavily scarred on the right side of his headin addition to these incidents a dead killer whale is beached at a nearby lighthouse with large wounds all over its body which police chief martin brody roy scheider suggests were caused by a great white shark once again mayor vaughn murray hamilton doesnt share brodys belief that the town has another shark problem and warns him not to do something hasty later brody spots a section of a ruined speedboat bobbing in the surf just off the beach when he goes to retrieve it he encounters the burnt remains of the female speedboat driverbrody angrily grounds his son mike mark gruner because of his reluctance to find a summer job preferring to go sailing every day and gives him a job at the beach the following day while brody is in an observation tower he sees a large shadow produced by a school of bluefish which he mistakes for a shark in his haste brody orders everyone out of the water and fires his gun causing a panic later that evening he receives the photo of the sharks eye taken by one of the attacked divers brody shows it to vaughn and his townsmen but they refuse to accept the evidence put in front of them len peterson joseph mascolo who has built a new resort in amity to attract people and the town council fire brody for the beach incident with mayor vaughn being the only one to vote against dismissal and promote deputy hendricks jeffrey kramer to brodys positionthe next morning mike sneaks out and goes sailing with his friends but has to take his young brother sean mark gilpin along to stop him telling his parents about mikes trip later they go past a group of divers led by tom andrews barry coe tom encounters the shark minutes after entering the water to catch lobsters and escapes but suffers an embolism due to rushing to the surface too fast tina ann dusenberry and eddie gary dubin later encounter the shark when he smashes into their sailboat devouring eddie and leaving tina terrified and alonebrody and his wife ellen lorraine gary find the panicked diver being put into an ambulance and brody suspects that something must have scared him to make him come up so fast hendricks informs brody that mike has gone out sailing to the lighthouse with his friends so brody insists on taking the police launch to rescue them with ellen and hendricks both joining him they find tinas boat with tina hiding in the hull who confirms brodys suspicions about the shark in the area hendricks and ellen take tina ashore in a passing boat while brody continues to search for the teenagers using the police launchall seems well with the other teenagers until the shark appears smashing into one of their sail boats causing panic and their boats to collide with each other mike is knocked unconscious and is pulled out of the water just as the shark appears two friends take him back to the shore for help the rest of the teens remain floating on the wreckage of tangled boats drifting out toward the open sea a harbor patrol marine helicopter arrives and a line is rigged to tow the boats to shore but before the pilot can tow them the shark attacks the chopper causing it to crash into the water sean also falls into the water but is quickly saved by marge martha swatek as marge tries to get back into the boat her hands slip on the wet hull and she falls back into the water the shark approaches and devours marge back at mainland tina is sent to the hospital and ellen berates peterson for getting brody fired and denying the sharks presencebrody encounters mike who informs his father about the situation sean and his friends are drifting on the wreckage toward cable junction a small rocky island housing an electrical relay station with the open sea beyond it brody quickly finds the teenagers but the shark attacks again which causes brody to run his boat aground on the rocks brody tries to tie a rope line but snags an underwater power cable instead most of the teenagers are tossed into the water during the sharks next attack and they swim to safety on cable junction
