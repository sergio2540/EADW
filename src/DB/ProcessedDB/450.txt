scaling el capitan muttering about kirks urge to play games with life while he makes his ascent kirk is suddenly startled by spock who hovers nearby wearing jetpowered boots spock doesnt seem to understand kirks need to climb the mountain kirk says because its there kirk suddenly loses his grip and falls spock races after him catching his friend before impacton nimbus iii the vulcan and his new followers survey the planets one settlement paradise city the move in and seize the city capturing three delegates general korrd a klingon caithlin dar a romulan and st john talbot a terran earthling the vulcan uses his persuasive power on all three convincing them to join his cause a distress signal is sent something the vulcan wantslater kirk mccoy and spock sit around a campfire and mccoy serves up homemade beans laced with bourbon the three talk about kirks neardeath experience kirk says he wasnt afraid because his friends were nearby when pressed a bit further he says ive always known ill die alone they sing row row row your boat together after educating spock on the songs meaning  which has no meaning and is merely intended to be fun for a group to sing together their vacation is interrupted with uhura shows up in one of the uss enterprises shuttle craft and tells them that kirk has been asked to deal with a sudden crisis in space uhura also retrieves sulu and chekov from the forest after they lose their way on a hikeon the enterprise things are chaotic the ships systems are constantly malfunctioning and scotty though happy to be working still has his hands full bringing the ship to functionality transporters are also malfunctioning hence the use of the shuttlecraft on the bridge kirk gets his mission orders from admiral bennett a cameo by harve bennett kirk and his crew are to travel to nimbus iii and rescue the prisoners in paradise city a video showing the vulcans small army the army of galactic light and their leaders demands is displayed for everyone spock seeing the vulcan in the video is suddenly overcome he explains to kirk that the leader is sybok an outcast vulcan who believed that the true meaning of vulcan culture and existence was the embracing of emotion spock knew sybok in his younger days before he left vulcan to follow his own pursuitsin a remote sector of outer space a klingon birdofprey decloaks near an old gemini satellite the ships commander klaa fires blasters on it destroying it klaa clearly bored desires a live target to engage his executive officer receives news of the distress call about the incident on nimbus klaa becomes excited knowing that kirk would be a formidable opponent he orders a course set for nimbus to intercept kirkthe enterprise arrives at nimbus and sends a ground crew down in a shuttle on the surface they first subdue an outpost outside paradise that is occupied by some of syboks followers  uhura is the bait doing an erotic fan dance to attract them donning the guards clothing and using their mounts they gain entry to paradise city at the same time chekov who has been given the conn on the enterprise negotiates with sybok from space as a distraction outside spock locates the prisoners however their ruse doesnt last and they are identified as infiltrators a battle breaks out several of syboks men are stunned and kirk makes his way into the tavern where the prisoners are being held when kirk finds them they take him prisoner and lead him outside where the rest of kirks team have also been capturedspock meets sybok and tells his fellow vulcan that he is under arrest sybok laughs saying that he is happy to see spock has developed a sense of humor spock deadpans that he wasnt joking sybok turns his attention to kirk and tells him he intends to steal the enterprise refusing to say what he needs it for with no choice left to him they all head back to the shuttle and take offon the enterprise the klingon birdofprey is detected right before it cloaks chekov orders the shields raised which prevents the shuttle from docking the usual procedure of using the tractor beam to lock on the shuttle will take far too much time a period in which klaa could easily destroy both vessels kirk orders sulu to fly the shuttle in manually an extremely dangerous procedure klaas attack fails and the shuttle crash lands in the docking bay the enterprise races off at warp leaving klaa excited that his target is so elusivein the cargo bay kirk and sybok regain consciousness first and grapple over a rifle sybok seizing it first he leads kirk out at gunpoint kirk attacks him but fails to subdue the vulcan the rifle is retrieved by spock who points it at sybok despite kirks shouted order to shoot sybok he doesnt and they are imprisoned once again much to kirks consternation they are led away and sybok requests a private moment with sulu and uhurain the brig which according to spock who acted as the test subject is escapeproof kirk admonishes spock for not protecting his ship and his crewmates by shooting sybok spock says that he could not shoot sybok because they are half brothers sybok being the child of a relationship his father had with a vulcan priestess before he met spocks human mother while they are trapped in the brig sybok reveals his plan the enterprise will travel through the galaxys great barrier where he believes they will find a place called sha ka ree what humans would call eden or paradise kirk remarks that no one has ever returned from beyond the great barrier nor has any probe which is not true if one were to include the original series in which the enterprise went through and back twice once in season 1 episode 3 where no man has gone before and season 2 episode 22 by any other name spock remarks that sybok has spent his entire life searching for the vulcan paradise just then they receive a message through the wall in ancient morse code telling them to stand back scotty breaks through the wall freeing them they make their way through the ships back tunnels scotty directs them to a turboshaft where they can reach the ships observation deck to send a distress message to starfleet scotty continues walking and bangs his head falling unconsciouswent through and backmeanwhile kirk spock and mccoy must climb the turboshafts ladder by hand they begin but spock disappears for a moment he floats to them using his jetpowered boots however they cannot take the weight of all three they float down where sulu and syboks men wait to recapture them spock activates the boot thrusters a dangerous move but one that propels them away from their captors the three make it to the observation deck and send their message however they are quickly found by sybok himself sybok doesnt mind that the message was sent saying that once his discovery is confirmed everyone in the galaxy will want to come to the barrier to see for themselves kirk still objects demanding control of his ship sybok asks to be alone with kirk spock and mccoy he shows them the power he possesses to turn them into his followers mccoy is forced to confront the death of his father from a disease that was cured a few months later mccoy says he wanted his father to die with dignity rather than suffer spock is forced to confront his fathers lifelong disapproval of his halfhuman ethnicity kirk refuses to succumb to syboks will saying he needs his pain because it makes him human just then a signal from the bridge tells them that theyve reached the great barrierkirk allows the enterprise to breach the barrier inside they find a barren planetoid bearing no life readings mccoy spock kirk and sybok take a shuttle down to the surface after walking a short distance sybok cries out demanding to see god suddenly several fingerlike rocks burst from the surface forming a semicircle inside a strange glowing being that resembles the christian image of god appears and greets them sybok tells it that he breached the great barrier to find it the being tells sybok that it wants to use the starship they came in to spread its benevolence to the rest of the galaxy while the others stare in awe kirk asks the being why if it is allpowerful it needs a starship to travel from its home when the being asks who kirk is and why he would doubt him kirk suggests it should know already if its actually god in anger the being suddenly shoots kirk with an energy bolt wounding but not killing him spock steps forward and demands an answer to kirks question and is also hit by the energy bolt mccoy says he doubts any god that inflicts pain and sybok asks the being who it really is it takes the form of sybok himself and sybok realizes that the being is the sum total of his own obsession and arrogance he tries to grab the being and help it release its pain and is consumed as they escape from the beings lair kirk has spock and mccoy beamed up on the enterprise spock sees that klaa has arrived in his ship and his threatening the enterprise with destruction spock turns to general korrd to do somethingkirk runs finally being cornered by the beast when klaas birdofprey appears and blasts the creature into oblivion kirk thinks hes done for when hes beamed aboard the birdofprey on board is korrd who barks a few orders to captain klaa klaa apologizes saying he made an unauthorized attack on the enterprise he also introduces his new gunner spock who fired the blast that destroyed the evil being on the planet below kirk says he thought he was finished spock tells him that he was never alone both klingons and humans and other federation races alike later attend a reception on the enterprise that suggests a new era of cooperation has begunthe film closes with kirk mccoy and spock back on earth in yosemite park once
