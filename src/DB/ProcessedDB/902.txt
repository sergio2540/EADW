often entering conversations halfway through pipes in but is promptly told by walter youre out of your element walter then tells dude about a millionaire who shares dudes name and must be the one the thugs were after dude agrees to meet with the big lebowski hoping to get compensation for his rug since it tied the room together and figures that his wife bunny shouldnt be owing money around townarriving at lebowskis mansion dude is assisted by brandt philip seymour hoffman who shows him numerous awards and pictures illustrating lebowskis endeavors in philanthropy before dude is brought to meet him face to face the elder and wheelchairbound lebowski david huddleston brings dude into his study where he quickly gets to the point and professes that he cant take responsibility for every spoiled rug in the city and accuses dude of seeking a handout clearly resentful of his hippielike demeanor dude leaves the room and tells brandt that lebowski offered any rug in the house to him he quickly picks one out and as its being loaded into dudes car he speaks to a young blonde tara reid poolside who is painting her toenails green she asks dude to blow on her toes assuring him that uli peter stormare the man in the pool wont mind because hes a nihilist brandt appears and introduces her as bunny lebowski before she offers dude fellatio for 1000 brandt nervously laughs and escorts

opposite team smokey jimmie dale gilmore bowls an 8 and tells the dude to mark it but walter objects stating smokeys foot was over the line when smokey argues walter pulls out a gun and aims it in

rent and informs him that hes performing a dance at a local theater and would like dude to attend to give him notes the dude obliges as brandt rings again telling dude that lebowski needs to see him and that its not about the rugat the lebowski mansion brandt solemnly leads dude into the study where he finds lebowski crying beside the lit fireplace he shows dude a note describing bunnys kidnapping and the demand for 1 million this is a bummer man dude offers as he smokes a joint brandt explains that they want dude to act as courier to deliver the payment when they receive word of a location for the drop off and tells dude that he might even recognize the kidnappers as the same people who soiled his rugbowling alley league game a man wearing a hairnet and a purple jumpsuit with jesus embroidered on the front bowls a perfect strike a few lanes down dude donny and walter watch him with slight resentment dude compliments on jesus john turturro skill but walter criticizes him for being a pederast having served six months for exposing himself to an eight yearold before asking dude about the lebowski arrangement dude explains that he will receive 20000 as courier and shows walter the beeper brandt gave him he doesnt worry about the hand off and figures that bunny kidnapped herself for some extra money walter seems to take bunnys offense personally as jesus walks over telling them to watch out for his team and if they flash a piece at the finals ill take it away from you stick it up your ass and pull the fucking trigger till it goes clickat his apartment dude lies happily on his new rug listening to a bowling game through headphones he opens his eyes and sees a woman and two men standing over him before he is punched in the face and knocked out he dreams that he is flying over la chasing a woman who is riding his rug ahead of him a bowling ball suddenly appears in his hand and pulls him to the ground where he stands miniaturized facing a gigantic bowling ball as it rolls towards him he tenses and winds up in one of the finger holes of the ball from his perspective we see the ball roll down the lane away from its female bowler towards the pins as the pins scatter the dude wakes up to the sound of his beeper going off and finds that his rug has been taken from underneath himanswering the page dude returns to lebowskis mansion where brandt explains that the kidnappers want the exchange to happen that very night he gives dude a portable phone and a briefcase with the money instructing him to take it up the highway and wait for the kidnappers to call once the exchange is complete dude is to call brandt immediately before he leaves brandt repeats to dude that her life is in your handsdespite brandts instructions to go alone dude picks up walter from his store walter gets in the drivers seat and immediately proposes a plan for a switch holding his own briefcase full of dirty underwear so that he and dude can keep the million themselves dude is adamantly against this but when the kidnappers call dude accidentally lets slip that hes not alone the kidnappers hang up and dude panics that bunny is as good as dead though walter reminds him of his own suspicions that bunny kidnapped herself the kidnappers call again and give a location granted there is no funny schtuff at the designated location the kidnappers call and instruct the dude to throw the suitcase out the car window onto a bridge as they approach the bridge dude tries to throw the real suitcase but at the last second walter tosses the ringer and forces dude to take the wheel as he arms himself with an uzi and bails out of the moving car despite his seemingly flawless and heroic plan walter loses grip of the uzi and it fires wildly hitting dudes tail lights and tires causing him to panic and crash into a telephone pole three men on motorcycles appear just beyond the bridge and as dude scrambles out of the car with the briefcase pick up the ringer and ride off walter calmly gets up and says fuck it dude lets go bowlingat the alley the portable phone no doubt brandt calling to check on the mission rings incessantly dude is miserable angry at walter and certain that bunny will be killed though walter is calm and convinced that bunny kidnapped herself he tells dude not to worry and that bunny will eventually get bored and return home on her own but becomes dismayed to see that the bowling schedule has him playing on saturday something he is forbidden to do since he is shomer shabbos and must honor the jewish day of rest dude wonders why walter didnt go back to being catholic since he only converted for his exwife donny interjects midconversation and is again told to shut the fuck up by walteras they leave dude discovers his car missing  along with the briefcase walter suggests it was towed because they parked in a handicapped spot but dude is certain that it was stolen he starts walking home with his phone ringingdude resolves to call the police and issue a statement for his stolen car two police officers richard gant christian clemenson arrive at his apartment to take notes and dude addresses the separate issue of his missing rug just before his home phone rings the answering machine records a woman introducing herself as maude lebowski and saying that she is the one who took his rug and has sent a car to pick dude up at his apartment the younger of the two cops is pleased that the missing rug issue is resolvedthe dude is brought to a huge loft studio filled with canvases and scarcely illuminated as he walks in he is startled by the sudden appearance of maude swinging in naked on a zip line screaming and flailing paintbrushes over a large canvas to create an abstract image she descends to the ground and is robed before addressing dude she explains that she is a professional artist whose work is commended as strongly vaginal often to the point of making some men uncomfortable she tells dude that the rug he took was a gift from her to her late mother and her father big lebowski had no right giving it away maudes flamboyant assistant knox harrington david thewlis watches as dude fixes himself a white russian and maude puts a tape in her vcr she asks dude if he enjoys sex as the video rolls a smut film starring bunny lebowski and uli the german nihilist credited as karl hungus maude surmises that bunny kidnapped herself elaborating on the already obvious notion that she gets around and even bangs the producer of the film jackie treehorn as one of two trustees of little lebowski urban achievers one of lebowskis charity programs maude noticed a withdrawal of 1 million from its funds and was told it was for the ransom though she is more or less estranged from her father she doesnt want to involve the police in his embezzlement and offers the dude ten percent of the million if he retrieves the money from the kidnappers with a finders fee she tells him he can buy a new rug she then apologizes for the crack on the jaw and gives the dude a number for a doctor who will examine him free of chargethe dude is given a limo ride back to his apartment where the driver dom irrera points out a blue volkswagen beetle that had been following them before the dude has a chance to do anything about it hes shoved into another limo waiting for him on the street inside brandt and lebowski confront him about the fact that he never called them and yell that the kidnappers never got the money lebowski accuses dude of stealing the million himself as dude tries to reason that the royal we dropped off the money and that bunny since she apparently owes money all over town most likely kidnapped herself and probably instructed her kidnappers to lie about the hand off brandt and lebowski look skeptical before producing an envelope lebowski tells dude that the kidnappers will be dealing directly with him now and any mishaps will be avenged tenfold on him inside the envelope dude finds a severed pinky toe wrapped in gauze with green polish on the nailin a small cafe the dude tells walter about the severed toe who doesnt believe its bunnys walter calls the kidnappers a bunch of fucking amateurs for using such an obviously fake ruse but the dude isnt convinced walter tries to convince him by saying that he can get a toe for him in no time at all and with his choice of nail polish color despite walters unwavering stance dude fears for his life if the kidnappers dont get him lebowski willat home he tries to relax in the tub smoking a joint and listening to music his phone rings and the answering machine records the lapd telling him that theyve recovered his car dude is overjoyed for a moment until he hears a loud banging in his living room he looks up to see three men breaking into his apartment wearing dark clothes the leader whom dude recognizes as ulikarl hungus the nihilist along with his two cohorts franz and kieffer torsten voges flea enters the bathroom with a ferret on a leash he dunks the terrified animal in the tub where it thrashes and shrieks as dude tries to avoid it uli takes the ferret out letting it shake off and tells dude that they want their money tomorrow or theyll cut off his johnsonthe following morning the dude goes to the impound lot to collect his car which turns up badly damaged and reeking with a terrible stench an apparent victim of a joyride and temporary home to some vagrants the briefcase is gone dude asks the officer at the lot if anyone is following up on who might have taken the car but the officer mike gomez chuckles and sarcastically says that their department has them working in shifts on the caseat the bar in the bowling alley dude expresses his fears to an unsympathetic walter and an unhelpful donny unable to cheer him up they leave dude at the bar to find an open lane the stranger sits down next to dude and orders a sarsaparilla before chatting briefly with dude complimenting him on his style and wondering why he uses so many cuss words he offers dude one piece of advice before leaving sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar well he eats you gary the bartender peter siragusa hands dude the phone its maude shes miffed that dude hasnt seen the doctor yet and instructs him to meet her at her loft there dude informs maude that he thinks bunny was really kidnapped possibly by uli maude disagrees saying that bunny knows uli and kidnappers cannot be acquaintances she then dismisses dude to take a call reminding him to see the doctorat the clinic the doctor tells dude to remove his shorts insisting despite dudes assurance that he was only hit in the face driving home dude enjoys a joint while listening to creedence but soon notices a blue volkswagen following him distracted he tries to flick his joint out the window but it bounces back and lands in his lap burning him he screams and dumps beer on his lap before he swerves and crashes into a dumpster when he looks out the window the blue car is gone looking down he notices a piece of paper stuck in the car seat its a graded homework sheet with the name larry sellers written on itthat night at martys dance quartet walter reveals that hes done some research on larry and discovered where he lives near the innout burger joint he is also thrilled to report that larrys father is arthur digby sellers a famous screenwriter who wrote 156 episodes of the show branded walter is certain that larry has the briefcase of money and that their troubles are over they pull up to the house where the dude is dismayed to see a brand new red corvette parked on the street outside a hispanic housekeeper irene olga lópez lets them into the sellers home where they see the elderly arthur sellers harry bugin in an iron lung in the living room over the hissing of the compressor walter calls out that hes a big fan of arthurs and that his work was a source of inspiration to him before the housekeeper brings in young larry jesse flanagan a fifteen yearold with a deadpanned expression walter and dude interrogate larry about the money and the fact that he stole dudes car but get no response not even a wavering glance walter resolves to go to plan b he tells larry to watch out the window as he and dude go back out to the car where donny is waiting walter removes a tire iron from dudes trunk and proceeds to smash the corvette shouting this is what happens when you fuck a stranger in the asshowever the cars real owner luis colina comes out of his house and rips the tire iron from walter shouting that he just bought the car last week before going over to the dudes car and breaking all the windows dude drives silently home wind blowing in through the broken windows as walter and donny eat innout burgersback home dude talks to walter over the phone as he nails a twobyfour to the floor near the front door he yells at walter telling him to leave him alone and that he wants to handle the situation himself before agreeing to go to their next bowling practice he hangs up and props a chair against the door braced by the piece of wood and turns away as the door opens outwardly and treehorns thugs from the beginning of the film walk in they tell the dude that jackie treehorn wishes to meet with himthe dude is taken to a large mansion overlooking a beach front where a tribal orgylike party is going on inside dude meets jackie treehorn ben gazzara who appears friendly and agreeable as he mixes the dude a white russian and sympathizes for his lost rug treehorn asks him where bunny is to which dude responds that he thinks treehorn knows treehorn denies knowing and theorizes that bunny ran off knowing how much money she owed him treehorn is then excused for a phone call he writes something down on a notepad before leaving the room momentarily employing the roger o thornhill trick of rubbing a pencil lightly over the pad of paper to see what was written dude reveals a doodle of a man with a rather large penis he rips the paper out of the pad and sticks it in his pocket before returning to the couch as treehorn comes back he offers dude a ten percent finders fee if he tells them where the money is dude tells him that larry sellers should have the money though treehorn is not convinced dude insists hes telling the truth as his words begin to slur and his vision glazes over he mumbles all the dude ever wanted was his rug backit really tied the room together before he passes outthe dude falls into a deep dream where he sees himself happily starring in a jackie treehornproduced bowling picture entitled gutterballs with maude dressed in a seducing viking outfit as his costar they dance together and throw a bowling ball down the lane the ball turns into the dude floating above the lane floor and passing under ladies skirts when he hits the pins at the end he suddenly sees the three nihilists dressed in tight clothes and snapping super large scissors chasing him he runs from them terrified as he wakes from his dream staggering down a street in malibu while a police car pulls up behind him the unit picks him up as he slurs the theme song to brandedat the malibu police station the chief of police leon russom goes through the dudes wallet before he tells dude that jackie treehorn said he was drunk and disorderly at his garden party he tells dude that treehorn is an important source of income in malibu and demands that he stay out of the town for good dude replies that he wasnt listening which incites the chief to throw his coffee mug at him hitting him in the head dude takes a cab ride home and requests that the driver ajgie kirkland change the radio station since he had a rough night and hates the eagles the driver doesnt take kindly to this and throws the dude out as he stands on the street a red convertible passes by at high speeds its bunny listening to viva las vegas and as we see with a complete set of toes on each footdude returns to his apartment to find it completely wrecked he enters and trips over the twobyfour he nailed into the floor when he looks up he finds maude standing before him dressed in nothing but his robe she drops it to the floor and tells him to make love to her afterwards they lie in bed together as the dude smokes a joint and tells her about his past as a student activist and his current hobbies which include bowling and the occasional acid flashback as he climbs out of bed to make a white russian maude asks about the apartment and dude explains that treehorns thugs most likely vandalized it looking for lebowskis money maude retorts that her father actually has no money it was all her mothers or else belongs to the foundation and that lebowskis only concern is to run the charities maude gives him an allowance but his weakness is vanity hence the slut she tells dude this as she folds into a yoga position which she claims increases the chances of conception dude chokes on his drink but maude assures him that she has no intention of having dude be a part of the childbearing process nor does she want to see him socially the dude then figures thats why she wanted him to visit the doctor so badly until an idea suddenly comes to mind about lebowski dude calls walter to pick him up and take him to lebowskis mansion right away despite walters protests that he doesnt drive on shabbos unless its an emergency dude assures him that its just thatdude dresses and goes outside where he sees the blue volkswagen parked just down the street he walks over and demands that the man within get out the man introduces himself as da fino ajgie kirkland and explains that he thinks dude is a fellow private eye who is brilliantly playing two sides against each other the thugs and lebowski and means no harm to him or his girlfriend confused dude tells da fino to stay away from his lady friend and asks if hes working for lebowski or treehorn da fino admits that hes employed by the kneutsons bunnys family apparently bunnys real name is fawn and she ran away from her minnesota home a year ago and da finos been investigating since as walter pulls up dude tells da fino to again stay away from his lady friend and leavesat a local restaurant the three german nihilists and a sallow blonde woman aimee mann sit together ordering pancakes the camera pans down to the womans foot covered in a bandage which where her pinky toe should be is soaked in dried blooddriving out to lebowski mansion dude explains his new theory why did lebowski do nothing to him if he knew the payoff never happened if lebowski thought that the dude took the money why didnt he ask for it back because the briefcase given to dude was never full of money you threw a ringer out for a ringer he also figures that lebowski chose him an otherwise fuckup to get bunny back because he never wanted her back he wanted her dead while he embezzled money from the foundation as a ransom walter agrees with the theory but still believes he shouldnt have been bothered on the shabbosas they pull up to the mansion they see bunnys red convertible crashed into some shrubbery near the front fountain bunny is running around the grounds naked while inside brandt attempts to pick up her discarded clothes he tells them that bunny went to visit friends in palm springs without telling anyone despite his protests walter and dude walk past him into the study where a sternlooking lebowski sits dude demands an answer he accuses lebowski of keeping the million for himself while he used the dude as a scapegoat to cover up for the missing money lebowski says that its his word against dudes and no one would believe a deadbeat over him this angers walter who figures lebowski to be a fake handicap besides a phony millionaire and lifts lebowski out of his chair dropping him to the floor however lebowski lies still on the floor whimpering and dude tells walter to help him back in his chairat the bowling alley donny misses a strike for the first time and puzzles over this as walter drones about vietnam to dude who doesnt seem to be paying attention as he paints over his fingernails with clear polish jesus walks over criticizing the change in schedule from saturday to wednesday before issuing sexual threats the dude walter and donny sit unfazed as they leave the alley and head into the parking lot they are faced by the three nihilists who stand in front of the dudes flaming car well they finally did it he despairs they killed my fucking carthe nihilists demand the money or they will kill the girl but dude tells them that he knows they never had the girl in the first place the nihilists reply that they dont care and still want the money but dude tries to explain that lebowskis money was never valid he never intended to pay them off and walter shouts that without a hostage there is no ransom franz complains that his girlfriend had to give up her pinky toe because she thought she was getting 1 million but theyll settle for whatever walter donny and dude have in their pockets donny in the back asks if the men are going to hurt them and walter assures him that theyre nihilists and cowards as dude pulls out his wallet when walter refuses to take his own out uli pulls out a sword and walter engages in a fight with them throwing his bowling ball into franzs stomach dude hits kieffer over the head with his own radio while walter attacks uli and bites off his ear spitting it into the air he turns around and sees donny on the ground clutching his chest from having a heart attack walter comforts him as dude runs into the alley to call for an ambulancethe dude and walter are then seen at a funeral parlor speaking with the curator donny having passed away was cremated and they negotiate how his remains will be handled walter is outraged at the high prices of the receptacles and he and dude resolve to carry donnys ashes in a folgers coffee can they travel together to a windy cliff side overlooking the ocean where walter gives a heartfelt speech about donny along with a seemingly unrelated reference to vietnam before opening the can and shaking out the ashes the wind blows them back into dudes face coating his clothes beard and sunglasses walter apologizes and attempts to brush the ashes off but the dude yells at him for always making everything a fucking travesty and scolds him for yet another needless vietnam rant walter hugs him and tells him to fuck it man lets go bowling the dude eases downat the bowling alley the stranger sits at the bar as the dude orders two beers they greet each other and the stranger asks how hes been doing oh you know strikes and gutters ups and downs answers the dude as he collects his beers and goes to leave the stranger tells him to take it easy and the dude turns to reply yeah well the dude abidesthe stranger finds comfort in those words and rambles about how things seem to have turned out fine for dude and walter he was sad to see donny go but happens to know that theres a little lebowski on the way he assures us that the dude is always out there taking it easy for all us sinners and orders another sarsaparilla
