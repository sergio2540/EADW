a reported for gotham citys newspaper who has been following the bat attacks knox has so far counted 8 sightings in under a month and asks eckhardt if its true that police commissioner gordon has

clean up gotham and make it a place for respectable people once again this press conference comes just weeks before the 250th anniversary gala celebrating the birth of gotham cityback at the gotham newspaper knox meets one of the papers new photographers vicki vale knox is mildly interested in her but then grows even moreso when she tells of her interest in trying to find out who batman is knowing that commissioner gordon has a file on this vigilante knox intends to get into a charity benefit at millionaire bruce waynes mansion where gordon will be attending vale also decides to accompany himmeanwhile crime boss carl grissom is angered at the persistence of harvey dent figuring that the new district attorney could find out about their connection to the axis chemicals plant one of carls men jack napier nonchalantly suggests they break in and steal the files that could incriminate them carl takes to this idea and recommends that jack is the man for the job jack is reluctant but carl insists calling him his number one guymeanwhile at the charity benefit knox attempts to get information from gordon but fails with the commissioner denying that there is a batman on the streets vicki meanwhile meets up with bruce wayne who seems a little shy bruce eventually excuses himself when his butler alfred requests his presence in a secret command center bruce reviews video footage of the party and catches gordon talking to an associate who has received a tip that jack napier is going to axis chemicals to clean it out lt eckhardt is handling taking care of him but gordon goes there to take chargeat axis chemicals napiers men find the plants safeonly to find the documents they came for are gone suspecting a setup jack cautions his men to watch out shortly thereafter they are ambushed by eckhardt and his officers gordon shows up shortly after the gunfire and demands that jack napier be taken alive during the chase batman eventually corners napier and catches him just before he falls into a vat of chemicals however batman lets go and jack falls in gordon sees batman and orders him to halt but the caped crusader gets away gordon then instructs his men not to mention what they sawthe next day napiers death is ruled as a suicide but knox suspects that batman ended up taking care of grissoms man knox asks vicki to help him further investigate the case but she blows him off saying she has a date with bruce waynemeanwhile jack napier has managed to survive and makes his way to a seedy doctor to have his face repaired however the chemicals he fell into have permanently bleached his skin white and turned his hair green as well his face seems frozen in a permanent grin jack then returns to grissoms penthouse having concluded that he had eckhardt tip off the police and that carl set him up to die revealing his newlychanged face jack claims to now be the joker and kills grissommeanwhile vicki and bruce share a rather quiet evening in wayne manor while vicki is rather intrigued by bruce she finds that the large manor does not seem to reflect much on him when she invites him to an outing he declines saying he has to leave town for certain reasonsback in the criminal underworld the joker claims that grissom has gone away for awhile and has left him in charge claiming to oversee all of grissoms affairs the other crime bosses are not convinced and still fail to acknowledge this even when the joker electrocutes one of their ownmeanwhile vicki grows curious about bruce and follows him as he leaves his mansion though he said he was leaving town she finds him staying close to gotham following from a distance vicki sees him walk into an alley and lay two roses on the pavement she soon after calls knox asking to find any information regarding the street locationeventually one of the crime lords attempts to go public holding a press conference saying that grissom has left him and his associates not including the joker control of grissoms empire it is then that the joker appears and stabs the crime lord in the throat before driving offduring the press conference the joker dispatched one of his men known as bob to snap pictures of people there one of them is of vicki vale whom the joker soon grows infatuated withalso of interest to the joker is the axis chemicals plant using an unknownto the viewer combination of chemicals the joker creates a chemical known as smilex combined with any normal household product it causes a person to die of laughter leaving a permanent grin on the victims face because of this the public stops using any form of beauty and hygiene products as so far noone knows what is causing thisshortly after this vicki vale receives a request from bruce wayne to meet him at the gotham museum of art when she gets there she finds a table reserved and receives a gift box containing a gas mask within seconds the museum begins filling with sleeping gas vicki puts on the mask only to see the joker fleshtone makeup covering his white complexion enter and vandalize the art pieces before sitting at her table it soon becomes apparent that the invitation was sent by him for a rather twisted romantic evening for two for themsuddenly batman swoops in through the skylight and makes off with vale the jokers goons give chase following the batmobile through gotham when traffic blocks their way batman and vicki get out and run away on foot batman eventually distracts the goons while vicki finds a hiding place during his confrontation a couple bullets hit batmans chest and he goes downas the goons examine the body one begins to remove the batmans mask vicki attempts to snap a picture of his identity but her flash catches the goons attention this gives batman time to take them out before summoning the batmobile and both he and vicki head to the batcaveonce there batman reveals that he has found the source of the smilex drug and gives vicki the information to take to the press however before she can ask more questions she blacks out and finds herself in her apartmentminus the film in her camera from the previous night noting the time and the file that batman gave her vicki calls knox and the smilex information makes the front page and puts batman at the forefront of the peoples minds including the jokerbruce soon after pays vicki a visit and she angrily reprimands him for lying to her about leaving town bruce tries to explain more about who he is but their conversation is interrupted when the joker appears bruce attempts to threaten the madman to which the joker asks him a question ever dance with the devil in the pale moon light bruce is offput by this but has almost no time to react as the joker shoots him vicki watches as he and his men leave but when she returns to bruces body in the next room she finds it gone with a silver serving tray with a bullet in it bruce was wearing this under his shirt as protection when the joker shot himafter this ordeal vicki returns to the newspaper where knox reveals the information he found regarding the street where bruce was according to the newspaper this was the area where bruces parents were gunned down by an unknown gunman vicki soon begins to realize a bit more about bruce through thismeanwhile the mayor and his aides hold a press conference to cancel the 250th anniversary gala for gotham however their broadcast is interrupted by the joker who declares that carl grissom is dead and that he is in charge of the crime syndicate in the city much to the delight of the common people the joker announces that a party will be held that night with 20million in cash given out to the crowd and promising that batman will also appearbruce has been watching the entire event unfold and thinks back to the words that the joker had said the night his parents were murdered the man who gunned them down also used the dance with the devil line and bruce is certain that the joker killed his parents it is then that vicki appears in the batcave having been let in by alfred bruce tries to admit his feelings for her but knows that theres little time for words given what the joker is planningbatman first sends the batmobile to axis chemicals in hopes of blowing up all of the jokers activities while he destroys the facility the joker was not in the building at the timeshortly thereafter several giant balloons and floats make their way down the streets of gotham with the joker playing music and giving away free money batman appears soon after flying his batwing plane when the joker sees this he and his men put on gas masks and let loose smilex gas in canisters attached to the balloonsbatman shortly thereafter swoops in and flies off with the balloons saving most of the citizens once he has let them go he returns in an attempt to take out the joker the joker has other plans and takes out the batwing with one shot of a comically long pistol the batwing crashes and vicki who was nearby covering the parade for the newspaper rushes to the cockpit only to find noone thereit is then that she is accosted by the joker and taken up to the top of a nearby cathedral batman follows shortly afterward just as the gotham police arrive and lock down the building however they are unable to ascend the stairs when the joker uses an acid flower to cause one of the cathedrals bells to drop down and destroy the wooden stairwayat the top of the tower batman confronts the joker blaming him for the death of his parents however before batman can properly take care of the joker the clown ends up twotiming both batman and vicki and soon the two are dangling from the top of the cathedralshortly thereafter the jokers helicopter appears and the joker attempts to get away however batman uses a grappling hook that gets entangled on the jokers leg and on a stone gargoyle the weight of the gargoyle ends up causing the joker to fall to his deathin the aftermath of the ordeal the jokers men are captured and it appears that gotham is now safe batman has also sent a signal to the gotham police to use if they ever need to call on himmeanwhile knox is surprised that vicki isnt covering the event and that she seems to have given up on trying to find out more about the batman as she walks away she is greeted by alfred who is there to escort her to wayne manor with
