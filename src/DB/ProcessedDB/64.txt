the walls of shawshank he asks if red could find him a rock hammer an instrument he claims is necessary for his hobby of rock collecting and sculpting though other prisoners consider andy a really cold fish red sees something in andy and likes him from the start red believes andy intends to use the hammer to engineer his escape in the future but when the tool arrived and he saw how small it was red put aside the thought that andy could ever use it to dig his way out of prisonover the first two years of his incarceration andy works in the prison laundry he attracts attention from the sisters a group of prisoners who sexually assault other prisoners though he persistently resists and fights them andy is beaten and raped on a regular basisred pulls some strings and gets andy and a few of their mutual friends a break by getting them all on a work detail tarring the roof of one of the prisons buildings during the job andy overhears hadley complaining about having to pay taxes for an upcoming inheritance using his expertise as a banker andy lets hadley know how he could shelter his money from the irs turning it into a onetime gift for his wife he said hed assist in exchange for some cold beers for his fellow inmates while on the tarring job though he at first threatens to throw andy off the roof hadley the most brutal guard in the prison agrees providing the men with cold beer before the job is finished red remarks that andy may have engineered the privilege to build favor with the prison guards as much as with his fellow inmates but red also thinks andy did it simply to feel freewhile watching a movie andy demands red rita hayworth soon after asking red for rita hayworth andy once more encountered the sisters and is brutally beaten putting him in the infirmary for a month boggs mark rolston the leader of the sisters spends a week in solitary when he comes out he finds hadley and his men waiting in his cell they beat him so badly hes left paralyzed transferred to a prison hospital upstate and the sisters never bothered andy again when andy got out of the infirmary he finds a bunch of rocks and a poster of rita hayworth in his cell presents from red and his buddieswarden samuel norton bob gunton hears about andy helped hadley and uses a surprise cell inspection to size andy up the warden meets with andy and sends him to work with aging inmate brooks hatlen james whitmore in the prison library where he sets up a makeshift desk to provide services to other guards and the warden himself with income tax returns and other financial advice there andy sees an opportunity to expand the prison library starting with asking the maine state senate for funds he starts writing letters and sending them every week his financial support practice became so appreciated that even guards from other prisons when they came for interprison baseball matches sought andys financial advice andy even ends up doing nortons taxes the next seasonnot long afterward brooks the old librarian threatens to kill another prisoner heywood in order to avoid being paroled andy is able to talk him down and brooks is paroled he goes to a halfway house but finds it impossible to adjust to life outside the prison he eventually commits suicide when his friends suggest that he was crazy for doing so red tells them that brooks had obviously become institutionalized essentially conditioned to be a prisoner for the rest of his life and unable to adapt to the outside world red remarks these walls are funny first you hate em then you get used to em enough time passes you get so you depend on themafter six years of writing letters andy receives 200 from the state for the library along with a collection of old books and records though the state senate thinks this will be enough to get andy to halt his letterwriting campaign he is undaunted and doubles his effortswhen the donations of old books and records arrive at the wardens office andy finds a copy of mozarts the marriage of figaro among the records he locks the guard assigned to the wardens office in the bathroom and plays the record on a phonograph over the prisons pa system the entire prison seems captivated by the music  red remarks that the voices of the women in the intro made everyone feel free if only for a brief time outside the office norton appears furious at the act of defiance and orders andy to turn off the record player andy reaches for the needle arm at first then turns the volume on the phonograph up the warden orders hadley to break into the office and andy is sent immediately to solitary confinement for two weeks when he gets out he tells his friends that it was the easiest time stretch ever did in the hole because he thought of mozarts figaro when the other prisoners tell him how unlikely that could be he tells them that hope can sustain them red is not convinced and leaves bitter at the thoughtwith the enlarged library and more materials andy begins to teach those inmates who want to receive their high school diplomas after andy is able to secure a steady stream of funding from various sources the library is further renovated and named for brookswarden norton profits on andys knowledge of bookkeeping and devises a scheme whereby he put prison inmates to work in public projects which he won by outbidding other contractors cheap labor from the prisoners occasionally he let others get some contracts if they bribe him andy launders money for the warden by setting up many accounts in different banks along with several investments using a fake identity randall stephens he shared the details only with his friend red noting that he had to go to prison to learn how to be a criminalin 1965 a young prisoner named tommy gil bellows comes to shawshank andy suggests that tommy take up another line of work besides theft the suggestion really gets to tommy and he works on achieving his high school equivalency diploma though tommy is a good student he is still frustrated when he takes the exam itself crumpling it up and tossing it in the trash andy retrieves it and sends it inone day red tells tommy about andys case tommy is visibly upset at hearing andys story and tells andy and red that he had a cellmate in another prison who boasted about killing a man who was a pro golfer at the country club he worked at along with his lover the womans husband a banker had gone to prison for those murders with this new information andy full of hope meets with the wardens expecting he could help him get another trial with tommy as a witness the reaction from norton is completely contrary to what andy hoped for andy says emphatically that he would never reveal the money laundering schemes he had set up for norton over the years  the warden becomes furious and orders him to solitary for a month the warden later meets with tommy alone and asks him if hell testify on andys behalf tommy enthusiastically agrees and the warden has him shot dead by hadleywhen the warden visits andy in solitary he tells him that tommy was killed while attempting escape andy tells norton that the financial schemes will stop the warden counters saying the library will be destroyed and all its materials burned andy will also lose his private cell and be sent to the block with the most hardened criminals the warden gives andy another month in solitaryafterwards andy returns to the usual daily life at shawshank a seemingly broken man one day he talks to red about how although he didnt kill his wife his personality drove her away which led to her infidelity and death he says if hes ever freed or escapes hed like to go to zihuatanejo a beach town on the pacific coast of mexico he also tells red how he got engaged he and his future wife went up to a farm in buxton maine to a large oak tree at the end of a stone wall the two made love under the tree after which he proposed to her he tells red that if he should ever be paroled he should look for that field and that oak tree there under a large black volcanic rock that would look out of place andy has buried a box that he wants red to have andy refuses to reveal what might be in that boxlater andy asks for a length of rope leading red and his buddies to suspect he will commit suicide at the end of the day norton asks andy to shine his shoes for him and put his suit in for drycleaning before retiring for the nightthe following morning andy is not accounted for as usual from his cell at the same time norton becomes alarmed when he finds andys shoes in his shoebox instead of his own he rushes to andys cell and demands an explanation hadley brings in red but red insists he knows nothing of andys plans becoming increasing hostile and paranoid norton starts throwing andys sculpted rocks around the cell when he throws one at andys poster of raquel welch where it used to hold marilyn monroe and rita hayworth before the rock punches through and into the wall norton tears the poster away from the wall and finds a tunnel just wide enough for a man to crawl throughduring the previous nights thunderstorm andy wore nortons shoes to his cell catching a lucky break when no one notices he packs some papers and nortons clothes into a plastic bag tied it to himself with the rope hed asked for and escapes through his hole the tunnel hed excavated led him to a space between two walls of the prison where he found a sewer main line using a rock he hits it in time with the lightning strikes and eventually burst it crawling through 500 yards in the pipe and through the raw sewage contained in it andy emerged in a brook outside the walls a search team later found his uniform and his rock hammer which had been worn nearly to nothingthat morning andy walks into the maine national bank in portland where he had put warden nortons money using his assumed identity as randall stephens and with all the necessary documentation he walked out with a cashiers check before he leaves he asks them to drop a package in the mail he continues his visitations to nearly a dozen other local banks ending up with some 370000 the package contained warden nortons account books which were delivered straight to the portland daily bugle newspapernot long after the police storms shawshank prison hadley is arrested for murder red said he was taken away crying like a little girl warden norton finally opens the safe which he hadnt touched since andy escaped and instead of his books he finds the bible he had given andy norton opens it to the book of exodus and finds that the pages have been cut out in the shape of andys rock hammer norton walks back to his desk as the police pound on his door takes out a small revolver and shoots himself under the chin red remarks that he wondered if the warden thought right before pulling the trigger how andy could ever have gotten the best of himshortly after red receives a postcard from fort hancock texas with nothing written on it red takes it as a sign that andy made it into mexico to freedom red and his buddies would spend their time talking about andys exploits with a lot of embellishments but red just missed his friendat reds next parole hearing in 1967 he talked to the parole board about how rehabilitated was a madeup word and how he regretted his actions of the past his parole is granted this time he goes to work at a grocery store and stays at the same halfway house room brooks had stayed in he frequently walks by a pawn shop which had several guns and compasses in the window at times he would contemplate trying to get back into prison but he remembered the promise he had made to andyone day with a compass he bought from the pawn shop he followed andys instructions hitchhiking to buxton and arriving at the stone wall andy described just like andy said there was a large black stone under it was a small box containing a large sum of cash and instructions to find him he said he needed somebody who could get things for a project of hisred violates parole and leaves the halfway house unconcerned since no one would really do an extensive manhunt for an old crook like him he takes a bus to fort hancock where he crosses into mexico the two friends are finally reunited on the beach of zihuatanejo on the pacific coast 9.3prison murder friend life-imprisonment
