james kimo wills jessica wilson ren√©e zellweger its the last day of school at a high school in a small town in texas in 1976 the upperclassmen are hazing the incoming freshmen and everyone is trying to get stoned drunk or laid even the football players that signed a pledge not to the end of the 1976 school year in a texan small town is cause for celebration of the summer break but first the seniors are excited to chase the newbies whom they may submit to merciless hazing which for boys takes the sternscorching form of nononsense spankings however futile attempts to escape are made yet
