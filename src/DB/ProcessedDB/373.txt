warriors dispatching several of them rapidly with his pistol the lawgiver 2 hersheys candidate is killed when he rushes into the command post and is shot immediately dredd kills everyone but the block war leader and charges him with several violations of the mega city municipal code before summarily executing him for the candidates murder he announces that court is adjourned outside the apartment he finds fergee hiding in a servodroid and finds him guilty as a repeat offender giving him five more years in aspen fergee claims hes innocent and was hiding from the block warriors however dredd refuses to be swayed and dismisses fergee to reincarceration dredd reports to chief justice fargo who questions dredds hardened methods of summary execution he believes dredd when the judge tells him that the executions were unavoidable fargo assigns dredd to teaching ethics at the academy a few days per weekat the aspen penal colony warden miller meets with a man named rico and gives him a small object that contains a copy of dredds badge and a picture of a reporter vartis hammond who has done several unfavorable reports on the street judges rico suddenly unlocks a secret compartment in the box and it becomes a small pistol which he uses to shoot miller through the throat miller is unable to match the voiceidentification that disarms the cannons in ricos cell and he is immediately killed by them rico hides and is able to massacre the guards who rush into the roomat the academy dredd tells a pool of cadets about the weaponry of a street judge and how little of it matters where knowledge of the mega city municipal code is concerned he also tells them that they stand a high chance of being killed on duty and that if they live to old age will undertake the long walk into the cursed earth where they will teach the savage denizens outside the city walls of the law hershey later speaks to dredd about his obstinate personality and whether he had any friends dredd tells her that he did have a friend at the academy but was forced to judge and sentence him when he broke the lawrico stows away on a shuttle from aspen in a body bag in mega city he goes to a pawn shop and retrieves a box set aside for him in the box is a judges uniform and a lawgiver pistol when rico reaches for the pistol the pawnshop owner warns him not to pick it up because all lawgivers are boobytrapped and will only recognize the grip of a street judge rico picks up the pistol is not harmed by the defense mechanism and shoots the man dead revealing that he is a judge himself rico finds a giant combat droid an abc warrior in the shop and reactivates it giving it the duty of being his personal bodyguardat hammonds apartment an unidentifiable judge bursts in and kills hammond and his wife the incident is captured on a security camera and hammonds final word is dredd dredd is arrested on the street and incarcerated for trialdredd chooses hershey to defend him due to her expertise in criminal law at the trial the recording from the security camera is presented however hershey successfully has the evidence dismissed as circumstantial since dredd cannot be positively identified however new evidence is presented the lawgiver 2 pistol has a secret feature that captures the dna of the wielder and imprints it on every round of ammunition fired the dna from the rounds that killed hammond and his wife are an exact match for dredd himself hershey and dredds defense crumbles and dredd is sentenced to death fargo who is overcome with guilt at seeing dredd one of his greatest students sentenced decides with some goading from justice griffin to retire as chief justice and leave mega city on his long walk into the cursed earth before he resigns fargo asks the justice council to commute dredds death sentence and send him to the aspen penal colony for life the council agrees fargo leaves mega city and griffin becomes chief justicelater when griffin returns to his office he is confronted by rico who demands access to a project called janus griffin tells rico that there must be a demand for the project to be implemented violent crime must engulf the city for griffin to convince the justice council to reinstitute janus rico promises to do just thatdredd is put on to a shuttle going to aspen seated next to him is fergee seated around him are several criminals who were sentenced by dredd himself dredd and fergee argue briefly about how dredd unfairly reconvicted fergee dredd claims the law doesnt make mistakes and fergee asks dredd to explain how the judge became convicted himself just then another con on the shuttle attacks dredd on the ground the angel family religious fanatics and pirates of the cursed earth blast the shuttle out of the sky with a rocket launcher in the ensuing chaos the pilots of the shuttle are killed dredd and fergee are the only survivors and are captured by the angels in the angel familys lair dredd identifies them as pirates and scavengers fergee in an attempt to escape their clutches suddenly proclaims himself a believer in the angels religion and is let go dredd then reveals the angels darkest secret they are cannibals and plan to eat fergee dredd frees himself and is immediately attacked by the angels whom he takes out one at a time when pa angel attacks dredd he is shot dead by one of the salvage team sent by chief justice griffin himself to investigate the shuttle crash nearby the two salvage men prepare to execute dredd when they are shot dead by chief justice fargo whod found the crash site fargo himself is critically wounded by mean machine angel whom dredd had knocked out moments before dredd fights angel and electrocutes him as fargo dies from his wounds he tells dredd about janus a sophisticated genetics project that tried to clone children with the best traits of the existing judges in an attempt to create the perfect judge there were two subjects produced rico and dredd himself the project was a massive failure with rico becoming a monster judged by dredd and sentenced to aspen for life fargo dies and dredd vows to return to mega city and stop rico from starting the janus project againback in mega city chaos erupts as rico using his abc robot declares war on the street judges many are killed and their numbers reach a critical point hershey detects a power surge near the statue of liberty and moments later is almost killed when her lawmaster cycle explodes the judges council meets and discusses the crisis knowing that they cannot replenish their ranks quickly griffin suggests that they unlock the janus project which can produce a fully mature judge in mere hours with the technology being more advanced than 20 years before its possible to create adult clones rather than children each member of the council gives their authorization as does griffin however they collectively object when they realize that the project was already a major failure just then rico enters the room and murders the entire council leaving griffin aliveoutside the city walls dredd and fergee are able to enter the city through a heat vent barely making it inside they enter the halls of justice where dredd steals a judges uniform dredd finds the murdered members of the council and griffin he also sees rico but fails to stop him griffin shoots himself in the arm framing dredd when

and fergee try to enter the lab rico has the robot shoot fergee and capture hershey with rico threatening to have hershey killed dredd agrees to listen to rico explain his plan to create a super race of judges that will do only their bidding dredd naturally refuses to join rico and they battle handtohand fergee distracts the abc robot long enough to disable it and hershey fights with ricos assistant ilsa hayden chief scientist of the janus project rico finally corners dredd where he hangs above the city rico tells dredd that his judgement is death for betraying rico years before dredd is able to distract rico with a flare from his lawgiver and pulls rico over the edge where he falls to his death hershey finds dredd and helps him to safetyon the street dredd is greeted as a hero
