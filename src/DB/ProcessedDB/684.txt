fire escape al yells for leary to freeze and holds him for a few seconds however he becomes distracted and leary opens fire killing al a search of learys apartment turns up a scrap of paper with the word sw kellum la on it it proves to be something of a dead end with no person of that name in los angeles or louisiana later frank rides the bus home looking very distraught hes at a bar when he gets another call from leary who again taunts frank saying he killed al in selfdefense frank ends the conversation saying hell desecrate learys grave after he catches and kills himas leary proceeds to
