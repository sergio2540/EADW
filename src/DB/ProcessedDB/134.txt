a group of reporters who are trying to decipher the last word ever spoke by charles foster kane the millionaire newspaper tycoon rosebud the film begins with a news reel detailing kanes life for the masses and then from there we are shown flashbacks from kanes life as the reporters investigate further the viewers see a display of a fascinating mans rise to fame and how he eventually fell off the top of the world the newspaper baron charles foster kane one of the richest and most powerful men in america if not the world dies a newspaperman digs into his past seeking the meaning of his enigmatic last word rosebud he finds evidence of a child torn away from his family to serve mammon grown into manhood charles foster kane becomes a newspaperman to indulge his idealism he marries the niece of the man who will become president of the united states and gradually assumes more and more power while losing more and more of his soul kanes money and power does not bring him happiness as he has lost his youthful idealism as has the america he is a symbol for after his death the life of charles foster kane  newspaper magnate and allround largerthanlife american  is told from the perspective of those who knew him a newspaper reporter is interviewing those in kanes life hoping to learn the meaning of kanes last word rosebud kane was sent to a boarding school at a young age after his mother struck it rich thanks to a mining claim that was signed over to her in lieu of rent he came into his vast fortune at the age of 25 and promptly bought a newspaper his idea of news was to make it as much as report it and along with his good friend jedediah leland had a rollicking good time unsuccessful in his bid for political office his relationships with those around him begin to deteriorate and he dies old and alone whispering the word rosebud multimillionaire newspaper tycoon charles foster kane dies alone in his extravagant mansion xanadu speaking a single word rosebud in an attempt to figure out the meaning of this word a reporter tracks down the people who worked and lived with kane they tell their stories in a series of flashbacks that reveal much about kanes life but not enough to unlock the riddle of his dying breath this is the story of charles foster kane the film opens with a long shot of xanadu  the private estate of one of the worlds richest men in the middle of the estate is a castle we see inside the castle a dying man examining a winter scene within a crystal ball as he drops it it smashes and one word is heard  rosebud what follows are pieces of newsreellike footage detailing how kane amassed his fortune and turning around full circle at the end its 1941 and newspaper tycoon charles foster kane orson welles who also directed and cowrote the script is dead the opening shots show xanadu kanes vast elaborate and now unkempt estate in florida interspersed with segments of his newsreel obituary are scenes from his life and death most puzzling are his last moments clutching a snowglobe he mutters the word rosebud kane whose life was news and whose newspapers not only reported but formed public opinion was central to his time a largerthanlife figure the newsreel editor feels that until they know who or what rosebud is they wont have the whole story on kane he assigns a reporter called thompson william alland to investigate rosebudthompson digs into kanes life and hears a lot of stories but none of them reveal the meaning of rosebud the reporter sees susan alexander kane dorothy comingore the tycoons exwife shes drunk and wont speak to him then he reads the unpublished memoirs of mr thatcher george coulouris kanes early financial adviser and childhood guardian who later became a prime target of the kane newspapers trustbusting attacks in one of many flashbacks the thatcher memoir shows kanes mother signing guardianship of the boy and his fortune over to thatcher despite his fathers objections when charles objected violently to being sent away with thatcher kane sr remarked what the kid needs is a good thrashing mrs kane responded thats why hes going to be brought up where you cant get at him some presentday fans of the film interpret this to mean that mr kane was abusive 1940s audiences were more likely to have believed that mrs kane was overprotective and that if charles had been allowed to grow up enjoying the love and discipline of his parents his life would have turned out betteryears later as he was about to get control of his business affairs kanes interest in newspapers was piqued when he noticed that he owned the struggling new york daily inquirer dont sell it he famously wrote to thatcher i think it would be fun to run a newspaper  a statement that exasperates thatcher greatly a scene where thatcher visited kane at the inquirer to talk him out of throwing so much money away on lowclass journalism showed kane using the paper to instigate the spanishamerican war but in the same scene kane earnestly told thatcher that he wanted to use journalism to protect the interests of ordinary peoplenext thompson interviews bernstein everett sloane the general manager of kanes newspaper empire in further flashbacks bernstein recalls how he kane and kanes college friend jedediah leland joseph cotten took over the stuffy unprofitable inquirer and transformed it into a moneymaker eventually hiring the staff of the rival new york chronicleat bernsteins urging thompson seeks out leland who recounts the story of kanes first marriage to emily norton ruth warrick and makes some negative comments about his onetime friends character charlie was never brutal he just did brutal things he married for love  thats why he did everything thats why he went into politics it seems we werent enough he wanted all the voters to love him too all he really wanted out of life was love thats charlies story  its the story of how he lost it you see he just didnt have any to give he never believed in anything except charlie kaneleland goes on to describe kanes second marriage to susan alexander kane started seeing her while he was still married to emily during his campaign for governor he ran on an anticorruption platform promising to investigate and bring down his opponent political boss jim gettys ray collins gettys found out about susan and threatened to tell the press unless kane withdrew from the race kane refused the story came out and he lost the election along with his first marriage he married susan who the nonkane newspapers describe disparagingly as a singer soon after his divorce from emily was final around the same time he allowed a drunken leland who served as the new york papers drama critic to transfer to the same job at kanes chicago paperalthough her singing talent was modest kane was ambitious on his wifes behalf he paid for voice lessons built an opera house in chicago cost three million dollars the obituary reel notes and financed an elaborate production for her debut the work susan stars in is identified as salammbo in the newspaper coverage but its a fictionalized version  the music was written specially for citizen kane after the opening night performance kane arrived at the offices of the chicago inquirer to find leland drunk again and passed out over his typewriter his cheek resting on his unfinished  and very negative  review of susans performance kane finished the review in the same negative vein and ran it in all his papers but fired leland susan wanted to quit but kane insisted she keep performing until a suicide attempt convinced him she needed to give up singing by this time thompson is interviewing susan herselfthe couple moved to florida and kane went to work on xanadu cost no man knows where most of the remaining scenes are set kanes 49000acre private pleasure ground ostensibly built for susan includes a manmade mountain a golf course vast gardens a zoo and of course a mansion in a huge echoing and nearly empty stone hall susan did jigsaw puzzles and longed to be in new york kane declined to leave xanadu but did arrange an event he called a picnic involving an overnight stay in the everglades a large animal spitroasted over a fire richly furnished tents musicians and many guests in their tent susan accused him of trying to buy love despite never loving anyone but himself and of never giving her anything that mattered he slapped her shortly thereafter she left him she almost wavered in her resolve to go when he begged her not to saying shed have everything her own way he lost her when he turned the emphasis back on himself saying you cant do this to me from the kanes butler raymond paul stewart thompson hears how kane trashed susans room after she left but stopped when he came across the snowglobe which we recognize from the deathbed scene as kane pocketed the snowglobe raymond heard him say rosebud raymond has no idea what it means however he tells thompson that he was in the room to hear kane say rosebud again just before he diedin xanadus big stone hall the reporters are getting ready to leave the place is jammed with packing crates full of art and household goods some valuable some not theres a shot of all the crates thats a clear ancestor of the warehouse shot at the end of raiders of the lost ark thompson explains to the other reporters that he never found the meaning of rosebud but that it doesnt matter i dont think it explains anything i dont think any word explains a mans life the camera pans across the crates and finds the sled that kane played with in the scene where his parents turned him over to thatcher the word rosebud is stenciled on it in the final scene men are tossing trash into an incinerator raymond says throw that junk in too and in goes the sled rosebud probably the only thing that always stayed with kanehe was a man who got everything and then again lost everything rosebud mustve been something he lost or something he wanted but never got the flames consume it in an exterior shot the camera pulls back from the smoking chimney to the chainlink fence with the no trespassing sign with which the movie opened and then to xanadus k
