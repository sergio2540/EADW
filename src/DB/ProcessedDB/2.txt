eurocopter it being unaffected by the emp three russian migs dispatched to the scene are destroyed two collide with each other when the electronic components within them are disrupted by the emp the last loses power and crashes directly into the huge satellite of the facility causing the antenna stalk to plunge into the ground simonova survives the destruction of the command center and is able to climb out of the underground portion on the antenna stalkat mi6 headquarters in a hightech observation room bond talks with tanner a specialist who tells him they found the missing eurocopter at severnaya by satellite imagery they also witness the total disruption of images in the region resulting from the emp bond spots a survivor crawling away natalya and reports to his superior m following

doubles as a grenadeourumov meets with russias defense minister dmitri mishkin and declares that he is resigning his post in light of the disaster at severnaya which he blames on separatist nationals mishkin is displeased and questions why ourumov has jumped to such a conclusion given that there was not only one survivor in the disaster but two the first boris grishenko a brilliant computer programmer had actually escaped with ourumov and onatopp and was listed as missing however they had not counted on natalyas surviving the blast boris summons her to a chapel via email and she goes

is able to shoot the chopper down pulling her into a tree and killing her bond and natalya discover that the lake really hides a giant satellite dish embedded in the earth alec and boris have activated the second satellites nuclear bomb and have programmed it to explode over london alecs plan is one of revenge against englands betrayal of his cossack heritage the emp will destroy every

make their way inside bond places explosive charges near fuel pipes and natalya finds a computer terminal to block boris programming of the goldeneye satellitea brief gunfight ensues and the fuel pipes are punctured causing the flammable fluid to begin pooling nearby alecs and boris command terminal bond is captured as is natalya and both are brought to trevelyan who quickly and easily disarms the bombs bond planted boris discovers that natalya has changed his access codes for the satellite and trevelyan threatens to kill bond if natalya doesnt undo her work having picked up bonds grenade pen boris begins playing with it pressing the button and activating the charge bond knocks the grenade into the pool of leaking fuel where it explodes causing a fire which threatens the entire facility alec orders boris to regain control of the satellite trevelyan races off to find bond and chases him to the satellite dishs large antenna while natalya takes control of a helicopter and its pilot on the antenna bond and alec battle handtohand during the fight bond is able to block the gearing mechanism controlling positioning of the antenna which prevents boris from regaining control of the nuke in orbit it subsequently burns up and the facility explodes boris appears to survive and declares himself invincible when a shower of liquid nitrogen freezes him instantly killing himstill fighting handtohand bond and alec find themselves at the bottom stalk of the antenna hundreds of feet above the dish the fight ends with bond throwing alec over the side holding onto his former friends boot alec asks if bond intends to drop him for england bond replies no for me and lets go alec plummets to the bottom of the dish and is still alive bond leaps to safety from the disintegrating antenna onto the helicopter natalya has commandeered and flies off just as the antenna collapses landing directly on alec the pilot leaves them in a nearby field where they are met by
