milo shouts for chopper to sick em boy gordie imagines that what milos saying is sick balls gordie frantically runs for the fence with the dog close on his heels but makes it over the top he turns and sees that chopper popeye is not the dog hed expected milo rushes over to the fence and berates the four boys for making fun of his dog teddy throws a few insults but is shocked silent when milo calls his father a loony teddy breaks down shouting that his father stormed the beach at normandy and has to be led away by the othersfollowing the train tracks they come to a bridge they hesitate to cross unsure of when the next train is due feeling confident they begin to cross with chris and teddy in the lead and gordie trailing behind vern whos chosen to crawl instead of walk midway vern loses a comb that he packed in his shirt pocket which hed hoped to use once they found the body and reported it to the local news gordie consistently looks back and bends down to feel the rails a light vibration leads him to see plumes of smoke in the distance he shouts train and yells at vern to get to his feet and run they are barely able to make it to the other side and off the tracks chris jokes that now at least they know when the next train isas they continue deeper into the forest chris lags behind with gordie who is despondent about being a writer and doesnt think much of his talents chris tries to encourage him saying that he wishes he was his father instead so that he could give him proper guidance and support they set up camp for the night and gordie tells them all a story about a kid named lardass hogan andy lindberg stuck with such a name because of his weight sick and tired of being made fun of for his considerable size lardass takes revenge on the rest of his town
