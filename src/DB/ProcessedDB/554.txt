defeating the smokers on the way mariner helen and helens adopted daughter manage to finally reach this paradisea creature of the sea mariner finds himself unable to tolerate living on dry land and sails off into the distancean undetermined amount of time in the future the polar ice caps have completely melted and the surface of the earth is an endless ocean a narrator tells us that the survivors of the ancient deluge have adapted to a new worldone such survivor known only as the mariner lives on a large sailed boat a trimaran and lives by recycling his own urine through a special filter he drags the ocean floor for artifacts to sell at atolls manmade island habitats where most of the last humans live while scavenging under the ocean surface someone boards the mariners boat and steals the fruit from his tiny lime tree the mariner surfaces and sees the other pilots boat he holds him at bay for a few minutes with a harpoon gun telling the pilot hes seen the boat before but doesnt recognize the man the man says he took it fair from the owner when he found him dead the pilot tells the mariner about an atoll where he can find suppliesjust then the two pilots spot two jet skis aboard both are smokers pirates who thrive on terrorizing the seagoing inhabitants of the earth smoke cigarettes and use refined oil for fuel when they spot the pouch of recovered items the mariner found on the ocean floor they race for it as they do the other pilot shows the mariner that he stole his limes the mariner throws several switches on his boat raising a giant sail giving his boat great speed he recovers his bag of goods then steers his vessel toward the pilot who ripped him off he breaks the mans mast leaving him helpless against the smokers who cease their chase of the mariner when they catch up with the other pilot the mariner sails offafter several days the mariner arrives at the huge atoll the other pilot spoke of at first hes refused admittance but the atolls guards allow him in when he shows them he has a jar full of dirt the worlds most precious substance inside the gates he finds that the people live in poverty and are near starvation one small group is conducting a funeral where the deceased is recycled  dropped into a pool of viscous waste the mariner docks his boat  is met by the atolls security officer who tells him not to make any trouble  that he has no more than two hours to conduct his business he first talks to an accountant of the colony who offers him a large amount of currency chits for the dirt he was carrying the mariner demands twice the amount and gets it at the atolls storebar a shady man named nord is asking another man desperate for a drink of fresh water hydro about a girl with a tattoo supposedly the tattoo has markings that give the location of dryland a piece of land not submerged in the deluge that covered the earth nord spots the girl enola who is in the care of the bars owner helen helen quickly hides enola but not before nord catches a glance of the tattoo on the childs backthe mariner finds the shop and spends his money on hydro a tomato plant  buys helens shelves nord approaches the mariner asking him about his new found wealth but the mariner remains unfriendly he marches back to his boat and begins to load his purchases on it a small group of people approach him asking if hell have sex with a young girl to impregnate her when he refuses the atolls council of elders become suspicious and decide to detain him when hes grabbed by two men they discover hes a mutant with webbed feet and gills behind his ears declaring him abominable they begin to beat him the mariner fights with a few guards plunging into the lagoon with one of them killing him when the man draws a knife hes hauled out of the water and beaten further until the enforcer stops them saying its not their way to dispense this type of judgementlater that night while in a cage the mariner spots nord leaving the atoll unannounced hes visited by helen  enolas friend gregor the atolls scientist who wants to study him  the mariner remains unfriendly helen visits him as well asking if hell take her  enola if he leaves he asks her to give him a dock cleat to pick the lock on his cage helen refusesthe next day the council has decided that the mariner is a danger to them and hes to be dropped in the recycling muck and drowned just then an armada of smokers led by the deacon launches a huge attack on the atoll the compound dwellers are outnumbered and outarmed during the battle the mariners cage is dropped into the muck when a smoker launched over the wall collides with it as he sinks drowning helen tells him shell free him if he takes herself  enola with him she opens his cage and they both work together to get enola onto the boat and allow it to escape the compound they barely manage to get the gates open and flee the deacon spots them and orders his fleet to attack his boat the mariner fires a harpoon at the armadas primary gunship using a cable to turn its guns on the deacons boat which is loaded with gasoline the boat explodes throwing the deacon off the mariner enola  helen escapeback at the wrecked atoll the deacon now wearing a bandanna to cover a lost eye interrogates one of the dwellers and finds out that enola escaped aboard the mariners boat the deacon assigns his fleet a new mission to find enolaaboard the mariners boat the mariner tells helen that she can stay but enola should be thrown overboard helen offers her body to the mariner but he declines when she picks up a harpoon gun and tries to hold him hostage he drops his sail on her  hits her underneath it with an oar knocking her outaboard the deacons vessel the deacon finds out that they are rapidly running out of oil for refining the deacon resolves to find enola and their way to dryland which is a matter of survival he orders two of his crew to take the small plane they have aboard their vessel  scout the area for the mariners boat while searching the pilot  his comrade find the mariners boat while the mariner prepares a counterattack so the pilot cant give their location away helen shoots the plane with a mounted harpoon gun the plane begins to circle the mariners boat entwining the harpoons cable in the sail rigging threatening to wreck the vessel the mariner climbs his mast and tries to shoot the plane down but is thrown into the ocean when the pilot is able to shoot  sever the cable the mariner furious at helens incompetence viciously cuts her hair short when enola protests he does the same to hersome time later the mariner spots another sailor helen loudly says that they may be able to trade with the man for food and they stop to talk to him the man turns out to be somewhat paranoid and neurotic and at first wants to trade some sheets of paper for sex with enola helen  the mariner refuse  helen agrees to have sex with the man belowdecks the mariner reads the sheets of paper which are pages from national geographic magazine  are strikingly similar to pictures that enola had been drawing indicating that shes been on dryland the mariner negates the deal with the drifter for sex rescuing helen when the man tries to fight his host the mariner kills him and salvages items from his boathelen still insists that she  enola need food the mariner preps a harpoon gun and jumps off the back of the boat using himself as bait a large sea creature swallows him live and he kills it with a couple of blasts from his gun he feeds helen and enola the flesh from the giant creature while he cooks extra meat for storage enola notices his webbed feet saying shed like to have feet like his when enola suggests that the mariner isnt talkative  a bitter loner he tells her she doesnt listen enough to the world around herafter a few days enola and the mariner come to an understanding that leads to a friendship he teaches enola to swim something shed never been trained to doa few more days after the three come to an outpost the mariner tries to communicate with them but the inhabitants dont respond verbally and simply keep waving the mariner uses an underwater periscope and sees smokers hiding below the outpost which had recently been pillaged by the deacon and his crew the mariner raises his sails and sets off barely escaping the smokers and their high speed vehicles the deacon takes aim with a rifle and hits the mariner in his side wounding himthe deacon decides to let them escape believing it wont be very long before they catch up to themhelen grows impatient wanting to know when theyll find dryland the objects on the mariners boat and the dirt hed sold at the atoll convince her that he can take them directly there the mariner says hes sailed to just about every point on the globe and has never found it however he will show her where he got the objects and the dirt he fashions a crude diving bell and takes helen into the depths of the ocean showing her a longsunken city denver colorado where there is plenty of dirt and items like the ones hes found when they surface helen mentions that she never wanted to believe the legends shed always heard that the world was covered with water in a cataclysm rather than being created that waysuddenly the deacon and his crew appear enola is already hiding and helen and the mariner are used as bait to flush her out enola is taken and the mariner and helen jump overboard the mariner kisses helen using his gills to breath for them both until their attackers have left helen and the mariner stay on the flotsam of his boat until theyre found by gregor the scientist from the atoll whod escaped in a crude hot air balloonedvehicle he takes them to a group that had also escaped the atoll attack and have joined their boats together in a makeshift atoll helen and the mariner try to convince everyone that the world was not created in a flood but covered by it a blasphemous concept they all agree that they must find enola and use the markings on her back to find dryland the mariner agrees to find the deacons vessel and rescue the girlthe mariner arrives at the deacons boat an ancient tanker the deacon has stirred his crew into a frenzy with a rousing speech about finding the path to dryland the crew begins to row frantically with giant oars not knowing that the deacon hasnt yet deciphered the markings on enolas back he holds her prisoner in the bowels of the ship threatening to kill her enola counters saying the mariner will come to save herthe mariner is able to infiltrate the ship and find the topside deck he approaches the deacons perch on the bridge and demands to have enola back the deacon believes hes bluffing until the mariner produces a flare holding over one of the vents leading to the tankers oil supply when the deacon mocks him the mariner drops the torch igniting the remainder of the oil causing the ship to burn the deacon grabs enola and tries to escape in his plane but the mariner stops him with a old anchor and cable downing the plane the deacon jumps off his boat as it sinks finding an old jet ski just as the boat is about to sink enola  the mariner are rescued by gregor and helen in gregors flying ship as they watch the ship sink from the air they see the name exxon valdez on the sternthe deacon uses a pistol to hit the small craft throwing enola off and into the water he sees that three of his crew are nearby on jet skis and they race toward enola the mariner ties a long bungee cord to his ankle and jumps down grabbing enola just before the deacon and his crew collide and their jet skis explodethe mariner and enola are pulled up gregor looks over the tattoo on enolas back and determines the direction they need to follow to dryland everyone falls asleep and the craft drifts through the air for a few days when it seems hopeless that dryland will be found the mariner sees a seagull on the the craft they drift through some clouds and see a mountainous island on the shore they find a tropical landscape with fresh water and food the enforcer finds a small hut in the woods with a couple of skeletons enola recognizes the home as her own the enforcer suggests that they bury the dead inhabitants enolas parents because it was their traditionthe mariner decides to leave being more comfortable on the ocean he builds a smaller boat than his trimaran and says a tearful farewell to enola he promises to find more atoll dwellers and drifters and bring them back in the extended version of the film enola and helen watch him sail off from the islands mountaintop where there is a plaque saying that theyre on the summit of mt everest 6.0sea smoker water future sail mutant sailing trading one-word-title boots destiny
