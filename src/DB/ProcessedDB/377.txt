his ears turned to cauliflower his speech slurred from being hit a million times and he slings punches anytime he hears a bell but his trainer and cutman army and miss miller a manipulative social worker support his illusion that he could be a movie usher a camp counselor or a romantic partner for miller but his manager maish rennick knowing the truth cant admit that hes bet everything he had that rivera wouldnt go four rounds against clay maish will pay with his life when the goon squad comes to collect if he cant persuade rivera to abandon his pride i fought 111 fights and never took a dive and agree to a wrestling contract of which hes ashamed when maish blurts out his secret rivera realizes that walking out on the deal is not an option to save the neck of the man whos betrayed him

maish feels the heat concerning his debt to ma greeny as a way out he talks to sleazy wrestling promoter perelli who thinks rivera would be great for exhibition wrestling its all fake requiring little

miller he believes he could be a camp counselor armys happy for him when maish brings up the wrestling idea however rivera feels slighted he worships maish feeling that he owes him a lot but he doesnt

comes to the ramshackle room where rivera stays she tries to get him to believe in himself but rivera knows hes only fooling himself the two briefly become intimate with a kiss but when rivera begins to make love she pulls away rivera thinks she should leave and she does after each says a gentle farewell she runs into maish on the way down confronting him for doublecrossing rivera and getting him

go on ma greeny walks in with her thugs when its clear to rivera that theyre going to kill maish if rivera walks the big fighter agrees to go on maish thanks him but its clear that his association with rivera and army also in attendance has forever been corruptedoutside maish runs into a young fighter hopeful but maish blows up at him his cynicism now at a boiling point he tells the kid to go home and forget about it as there are only eight champs in the world the rest ending up lost and ruined as rivera as a saddened army watches rivera dons his humiliating outfit then faces the crude
