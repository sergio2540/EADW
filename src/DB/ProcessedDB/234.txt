wilde dick young its a hot summer on amity island a small community whose main business is its beaches when new sheriff martin brody discovers the remains of a shark attack victim his first inclination is to close the beaches to swimmers this doesnt sit well with mayor larry vaughn and several of the local businessmen brody backs down to his regret as that weekend a young boy is killed by the predator the dead boys mother puts out a bounty on the shark and amity is soon swamped with amateur hunters and fisherman hoping to cash in on the reward a local fisherman with much experience hunting sharks quint offers to hunt down the creature for a hefty fee soon quint brody and matt hooper from the oceanographic institute are at sea hunting the great white shark as brody succinctly surmises after their first encounter with the creature theyre going to need a bigger boat martin brody is the new police chief of amity an island resort town somewhere in new england he has a wife named ellen and two sons named michael and sean on a summer morning brody is called to the beach where the mangled body of summer vacationer chrissie watkins has washed ashore the medical examiner tells brody that it could have been a shark that killed watkins mayor larry vaughn who is desperate to not lose the money that will be brought in by 4th of july tourists wants brody to say watkinss death was caused by a motorboat propeller instead of a shark because the thought of a shark in amitys waters would drive tourists away from amity it looks like vaughn is a mayor who puts money ahead of peoples lives shark expert matt hooper believes watkins was killed by a shark hooper is proven right a few days later when alex kintner is killed by the shark that killed watkins looking for the quickest solution vaughn tells all of the local fishermen to let him know if they see the shark a shark hunter named quint offers to find the shark and kill it but vaughn thinks quints price of 10000 is too high when a tiger shark is killed and hauled in by a couple of boaters vaughn hastily says that the shark crisis is over but hooper says the shark thats been killing people a huge great white shark is still in amitys waters but vaughn leaves the beaches opened because all he cares about is the 4th of july tourist money on the 4th of july vaughn encourages people to swim at the beach and hooper is proven right again when the shark kills a man biting the mans leg off michael who was in the water at the time of the attack is taken to the hospital where hes treated for shock after watching the shark kill the guy brody asks vaughn to hire quint to find the shark because his own kids were at that beach too vaughn agrees to hire quint to find the shark quint hooper and brody are sent out to sea in quints boat the orca ready to do whatever it takes to find the shark the peaceful community of amity island is being terrorised there is something in the sea that is attacking swimmers they can no longer enjoy the sea and the sun as they used to and the spreading fear is affecting the numbers of tourists that are normally attracted to this island after many attempts the great white shark wont go away and sheriff brody with friends hooper and quint decide to go after the shark and kill it a great white shark decides to make the small beach resort town of amity his private feeding grounds this greatly frustrates the town police chief who wants to close the beaches to chase the shark away he is thwarted in his efforts by the towns mayor who finally relents when nothing else seems to work and the chief a scientist and an old fisherman with revenge on his mind take to the sea to kill the beast late one night on one of the many beaches of amity island off the coast of new england local teenagers throw a bonfire party tossing back the booze and playing music chrissie watkins susan backlinie a beautiful blonde catches the eye of tom cassidy jonathan filley and leads him away from the frivolities towards the water where she begins to strip down she invites him for some moonlit skinny dipping and dives into the water as tom struggles to undress on the shore inebriated tom collapses and passes out on the sand chrissie continues to swim out to deeper waters when she feels a sharp tug on her leg confused she gasps in panic as she is tugged again before being pulled under water she breaks the surface screaming as something thrashes her around violently she screams for help again before submerging one last time and then the water is stillamity island is a small beachside community that prides itself in its humble traditions and popular oceanfront despite the population of locals on the island the community depends on tourism as a major source of economic support and waits eagerly for each summer to arrive when herds of mainlanders come to savor amitys shoresmartin brody roy scheider the new chief of police receives a call at home regarding watkins disappearance following the report made by tom cassidy that she was last seen off the coast brody goes to the beach with his deputy jeff hendricks jeffrey kramer to search for clues they dont need to look very long within a few moments hendricks stumbles upon chrissies mangled corpseat the police station brody waits for the coroners robert nevin report at his desk while the secretary relays the crime reports of the day nothing more serious than a few kids karatechopping picket fences the coroner then calls with his report brody hangs up and contemplates for a moment before typing the cause of death on chrissies report shark attack unwilling to waste any time he goes to the local hardware store and gathers supplies for making signs to close the beaches his intentions are quickly noticed by mayor vaughn murray hamilton who attempts to sway brodys notion that a shark was directly involved in chrissies death he explains that she could very well have swam out too far and gotten tired before being hit by a boats propellers during a town meeting brody tries to reassert his belief that chrissies death was caused by a shark and that he wants to close the beaches for the safety of the public much to the dismay of the islands business owners vaughn however garners the coroners support who admits that chrissie could have been killed by a boat propeller vaughn reiterates to brody that he doesnt want to act too hastily closing the beaches would sentence amity island to a dreary summer without tourists and they cannot afford to lose that source of income especially with the fourth of july approachingover the course of the next couple of days tourists flock to the island brought over from the mainland by ferry one particular day brody sits on the beach scanning the water nervously as people frolic in the surf splashing and calling to each other a young man  nm5026721 plays fetch with his labrador retriever in the surf an elderly man wearing a swim cap henry wiseman alfred wilde approaches brody and chides him about his apparent fear of water thats some bad hat harry brody replies annoyed young alex kintner jeffrey voorhees takes his inflatable yellow raft and asks his mother lee fierro if he can take it out in the water with her consent he rushes into the surf while brody continues to keep watch the beachgoers continue their fun splashing loudly the young man who had been playing with his dog calls to the unresponsive pooch the fetching stick floating in the water all at once brody notices a large grey object emerge out of the water and overturn the young boy on his yellow raft alex is tossed into the water and pulled under as his blood turns the sea red the other swimmers begin screaming and leave the water as brody ushers them back to shore mrs kintner approaches the waters edge calling for her son the only response is the lap of waves on the shore pushing alexs torn and bloody raft onto the beachshortly after mrs kintner issues a 3000 reward for the capture of the shark and a meeting is held between the towns business owners attended by mayor vaughn and brody brody assures the townspeople that they are assigning extra deputies and bringing in an expert from the oceanographic institute for advice on the matter but the main concern in town is if the beaches will be closed brodys yes is responded with a string of criticism but mayor vaughn quickly interjects that the beaches will be closed for only 24 hours the uproar of the townsfolk is suddenly cut short by the screeching sound of nails on a chalkboard behind them fisherman quint robert shaw remains seated as he calmly explains that a shark like this is not one to be trifled with and he has no interest in such meager compensation he offers to capture and kill the shark himself for 10000 which no one stands to offer quint quietly leaves a wry smile on his facebrody returns home and the following day tells his eldest son michael chris rebello that hes not to go anywhere near the water ellen thinks him to be acting a bit too harshly even when michael tests his new sailboat in the shallow water in front of their home when she sees a picture in a book that brodys holding of a shark attacking a small boat and puncturing the hull however she shouts for michael to listen to his father and get out of the waterthat very evening two men decide to take matters into their own hands and fashion a large hook baited with a pork roast they toss it out from a dock and it attracts the attention of the shark however their attempt to be heroes nearly turns fatal when the dock theyve secured the line to is detached and pulled out into the water by the beast taking one man with it he fortunately manages to swim back to his friend as the dock eerily turns and follows him back to shore eventually drifting back on its own harmlessamateur shark hunters and fisherman from all over descend on amity island hoping to get a claim to the 3000 reward that has apparently been advertised expansively by mrs kintner they crowd the waters surrounding the island creating some tension to local swimmers among the horde of newcomers is matt hooper richard dreyfuss who has arrived from the oceanographic institute he is escorted by brody to examine and give his professional opinion on the remains of chrissie watkins after viewing the body and recording his observations a visibly shaken hooper angrily informs brody and the coroner that no boating accident killed watkins it was a shark he states defiantlymeanwhile some of the local fisherman have successfully caught a large shark and haul it back to town where the body is strung up for all to see the townsfolk are ecstatic to see such a large find and are overjoyed and convinced that the killer has been caught however most are ignorant to the species until hooper and brody arrive hooper takes a look at the shark and informs everyone that its a tiger shark and that the bite radius does not match up with the marks he found on chrissies corpse mayor vaughn objects and claims that the beaches should be reopened but hooper maintains that he wont be completely satisfied until he can cut open the shark for more conclusive evidence vaughn however is not eager to do so in public at the risk of seeing the little kintner boy spill out over the dock at that moment mrs kintner arrives on the scene clad in a black mourning dress she addresses chief brody and slaps him across the face informing him that she found out about chrissies death and accuses him of keeping the beaches open and letting people swim when he knew there was a shark out there when she leaves vaughn consoles brody and tells him that mrs kintner is wrong no shes not replies brodyunsatisfied with how his findings took to the water hooper visits brody for dinner that night sharing his theories with ellen brody lorraine gary who is none too pleased about the presence of a large shark in the area but stands by her husbands intuition hooper discusses the possibility of a rogue shark in the area while brody chugs his wine hooper explains that a rogue shark will often claim territory to an area where the feeding is good and will remain there until the food source is gone brody agrees to take hooper down to the docks to cut open the tiger shark and find out once and for all if this is indeed the shark thats been terrorizing the island hooper cuts out the stomach and in a mess of bile and seawater recovers a few fish a tin can and a license plate from louisiana that confirms his suspicions that the shark swam up to amity from warmer waters there is however no sign of any human remains and hooper tells brody that hes still got one hell of a fish out there and measures out a space with his hands to show how big its mouth might bethat night brody and hooper continue their investigation and hooper decides that some reconnaissance out on the water is needed much to brodys dismay with sonar equipment installed on his boat hooper drives the boat out to deeper waters until the sonar detects a large object just ahead of them aiming their lights out they find a half submerged fishing boat that brody recognizes as ben gardners craig kingsbury a local fisherman hooper bravely opts to take a closer look underwater and dons scuba gear despite brodys protests hooper dives under and examines the hull of the ship soon discovering a gaping hole in the side where a rather large tooth is embedded as he peers closer into the hole the ghostly torso of ben gardner appears his one remaining eye gazing out in horror terrified hooper panics and drops the tooth as he scrambles back onto his own boatthe next morning he and brody attempt to reason with mayor vaughn who seems more concerned with an act of vandalism on one of amitys billboards the graffiti sprayed on the image of a woman swimming altered her face to one of horror and included a large black fin following her in the water hooper tries to convince vaughn that based on his findings the proportions on the drawing are actually correct and that with the evidence of gardners boat and his remains towed back to the island and the tooth he found the existence of a large killer shark cannot be ignored any longer vaughn is adamant however that the beaches will remain open for the fourth of july and tells hooper that losing the tooth is very convenient for him and he most likely wants nothing but the publicity to get him in the national geographic hooper can only laugh at the insult as vaughn walks awayon july 4th the beaches are flooded with mainlanders and tourists brody and hooper have their hands full keeping order and making sure that enough security is patrolling the beaches including boats full of patrolmen with rifles and shark spotters however the increased precautionary measures create tension among the beachgoers making them hesitant to enter the water vaughn notices this and convinces one of his local friends to take his wife and grandchildren out they do so nervously but this encourages more people to enter the water and releases the tension brody patrols the beach while ellen takes care of their youngest son sean jay mello michael and a friend begin to take his new sailboat out but brody tells them to take it to the estuary where its safer suddenly a shark fin appears in the water and everyone begins to scream in panic stampeding back to the shore and knocking a few hapless swimmers over vaughn watches in disbelief as brody oversees the situation the patrol boats quickly scramble towards the fin but discover that it is false a prank pulled by a couple of boys in snorkel gearas the chaos winds down a girl painting on the edge of the estuary sees a dark fin with the shadow of its body beneath it she cries out shark but the general reaction is desensitized by the fin hoax brody responds to the call and quickens his pace when ellen reminds him that michael is in the estuary michael and his friend sit in their sailboat and are approached by a friendly man ted grossman in a rowboat before both crafts are suddenly capsized michael surfaces and watches in horror as the man attempts to return to his rowboat only to be eaten alive by the massive shark his severed leg sinks to the bottom of the estuary and the shark swims back into open water michael and his friend are brought safely ashore though michael is unconscious from shock he is later brought to the hospital and brody confronts vaughn in the lobby and demands that immediate action be taken now that theres no doubt in anyones mind that they have a killer shark around the island vaughn shaken and distressed realizes his mistakes and tells brody that his family was on the beach too he allows brody to do whats necessarywith vaughns signature approval brody hires quint to hunt the shark promising the fee hed demanded earlier at quints boathouse brody and hooper discuss with him the terms of the voyage from the start quint looks down upon hooper for his academic prowess and believes that it will not serve him any good out on the raw sea however brody insists that both he and hooper will accompany quint despite his belief that they have no nautical experience  hooper mentions that hes crewed three transpac sailboats justifying his experience at sea when hooper ties a sheep shank knot with ease quint relents come morning they meet at the docks and prepare quints ship orca for the voyage hooper brings his own hitech equipment including harpoons tracking devices scuba gear and tanks and a sharkproof steel cage though quint is less than impressed with the safety guarantee on the cageonce at sea they attempt to attract the shark by chumming the water with fish guts and blood hours pass and quint sets up a baited line with piano wire and fashions it to a rod secured against a fishing chair he waits as brody practices his knot work and hooper plays cards quints line begins to pull and he eases into his chair quietly fastening straps to his shoulders and adjusting the rod just when brody successfully knots his rope the line jerks forward taken by something far under hooper projects that the taker might be a sports fish like a marlin but quint assures them that its their fish the line is pulled under the boat and quint marvels at the fishs clever move until the line completely snaps quint and hooper argue over what might have taken the line and quint suggests that hooper doesnt have the education to admit his error that no regular fish could have severed piano wire hooper makes a series of dirty faces and climbs up to the bridgelater on and still with no sign of the shark brody is assigned to chum duty a job that he has come to detest as he smokes a cigarette he scoops out the chum and blindly throws it into the water while casting quint a contemptuous look suddenly the massive shark surfaces its mouth agape but only for an instant brody quickens to a stand having seen enough of the shark to be fearful he backs slowly into the cabin and tells quint that hes going to need a bigger boat at that moment hooper sees the shark begin to circle the boat and quint rushes out to see it he wages a 25 footer three tons and orders hooper and brody to action quint grabs his harpoon gun and instructs hooper to tie the other end of the rope attached to it to one of the large yellow bins on the boat quint shoots a total of three harpoons each trailing a yellow bin into the shark but it doesnt show the slightest bit of fatigue and easily disappears below the surface as hooper manages to attach a tracking device to itquint is at first disdainful towards hooper after the shark escapes but that night the men bond after sharing drinks and comparing scars theyve received by some of the deeps more dangerous creatures hooper and quint realize they have more in common than they thought and begin to bond brody points to one scar on quint and he reveals that hed had a tattoo removed a tattoo that represented the us navy cruiser
indianapolis he tells the story of how he was on the ship the day two japanese torpedoes blasted a hole in the side large enough to sink the ship in minutes quint and some 1100 men went in the water but by the time rescue arrived only 300 survived some dying of thirst or exposure but most getting attacked and eaten by sharks quints hatred for sharks is evident describing them as lifeless with dolls eyes and how terrible it was to see and hear the men around him picked off worse yet for him is the survivors guilt he feels when help finally did arrive quint vowed never to wear a life jacket again as quint finishes his story the men sing a sea shanty as the three yellow barrels break the surface of the water outside as they finish their song the boat is bumped repeatedly and violently by the shark causing minor leaks quint runs onto deck and fires shots at the fleeing shark evident only by the barrels trailed in its wake and they quickly disappear beneath the wavesthe next day the hunt for the shark continues when they spot the three barrels floating in the water quint instructs hooper to collect them with a hook and secure the rope to cleats at the stern of the boat the shark begins to swim off again and hoopers legs are nearly crushed when the rope is pulled taught quint drives the boat forward at full throttle but despite the power the shark manages to drag the boat backwards threatening to capsize it until the cleats rip out of the stern out of options and with the barrels no longer attached to the shark quint allows hooper to try a new method hooper opts to submerge himself in the shark cage hoping that the shark will swim close enough that he can inject it with a harpoon filled with strychnine nitrate brody protests but hooper angrily retorts you got any better suggestions as he puts on his scuba gearin the cage hooper is ambushed by the shark which begins to rip the cage apart making short work of the metal hooper loses his harpoon but is able to escape and swim down to the reef while the shark destroys the cage brody and quint bring up the remains but before they can do anything the shark leaps out of the water landing on the stern crushing the transom the boat upends and brody and quint hang on for dear life as the sharks jaws gnash and water fills the cabin quint loses his grip and slides right into the sharks mouth the jaws come down on quints midsection several times and drags his lifeless body into the sea as the orca begins to sink brody retreats into the cabin and finds one of hoopers spare scuba tanks just as the shark barrows through the side breaking the window brody beats it on the nose with the tank before throwing the whole thing into its mouth the shark backs away as brody climbs out of the cabin and climbs onto the boats mast with a rifle in his hand as the shark circles again and charges brody now lying angled on the mast he aims the rifle at the shark and fires off a few shots missing finally he takes close aim smile you son of a bitch he says and fires hitting the tank and detonating it in a violent explosion the force rips the shark apart and its body sinks to the sea floor as brody laughs happilybrody grabs hold of a piece of flotsam as hooper surfaces unharmed together they create a makeshift raft and begin paddling back to shore as seagulls descend on the remains of the sharki used to be afraid of the water brody admitsi cant imagine why hooper replies 8.1shark great white shark island fisherman mayor beach boy boat shark attack shock hospital police chief fourth of july tattoo
