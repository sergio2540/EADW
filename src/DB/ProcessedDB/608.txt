and they all agree that that isnt the dr edwardes that they know dr edwardes is of course missing they go to see dr peterson in her room she says that she left dr edwardes in his own room and that he was too agitated to say anything sensible she also notices the letter on the floor near her door but is too frightened to pick it up while the others are present the police and other staff members leave dr murchison is the last to leave and seeing the letter on the floor picks it up and politely hands it to dr peterson she reads it after the others have leftthe next day she goes to the hotel in new york after managing to find out his room number by recognizing his handwriting on the hotel registration cards he registered as john brown she goes to his room and talks to him she wants to use her psychoanalytic expertise to cure him of his amnesia and guilt complex he believes that he must have killed dr edwardes taken his identity and come to green manors but she is absolutely convinced of his innocenceshe notices that his left hand has been burned he relives some kind of accident that he must have been in but cant remember any more details she asks him an abstruse medical question and determines from his accurate answer that he must have been some kind of doctor but when they find out that her name and picture are in the newspaper they have to make a quick exit from the hotel they go to grand central station to take a train somewhereat the station constance tells jb to freeassociate when he gets to the head of the ticket line and when the clerk ask for the destination say the first thing that comes to his mind he requests two tickets to rome constance explains that he means rome georgia after they get their tickets constance realizes that a policeman saw them and will recognize them soon so they cant go to georgia they instead take a different train to rochester new york home of dr alex brulov michael chekhov who was dr petersons teacher analyst and mentoron the train trip jb recalls that he was in the army medical corps flying over rome italy and his plane was shot down he was burned at that timewhen they arrive dr brulov is not in but two men are present it turns out that they are policemen wanting to know what dr brulov knows about dr edwardes dr edwardes disappeared on a trip in the cumberland mountains with a patient of his the elderly dr brulov arrives he is a stereotypical complete with a beard and a german accent oldschool freudian he is not friendly to the policemen and tells them that he disliked dr edwardes what kind of an analyst is it who wants to cure psychosis by taking people skating or to a bowling alley after the police leave constance announces that she is married and introduces her husband john brown dr brulov is delighted for her though he says in his strict oldschool way women make the best psychoanalysts until they fall in love after that they make the best patients he offers to put them up in his spare bedroom and bids them goodnight with happy dreams which we will analyze at breakfastin the bedroom jb is concerned that while they got past the police dr brulov might suspect something constance assures him that alex is actually not very savvy in social situations she is wrong jb has another anxiety attack while looking at the bedspread which is white with textured embroidery in parallel lines dr peterson realizes that parallel lines on a white background seem to be what sets off these attacksmedical ethics not to mention 1945 movie studio sensibilities require that jb sleep on the sofa while constance takes the bed during the night jb wakes up realizes that he is seriously in need of a shave and goes into the bathroom while mixing the shaving soap he has another episode set off by the white color of the soap the sink and the bathtub he goes downstairs in a trancelike state still holding a straight razor dr brulov is downstairs having awakened in the night and gone to do some work he offers jb a glass of milk he has noticed the razor and he secretly puts a large dose of bromide in jbs milkin the morning dr peterson comes downstairs wondering whether jb has left dr brulov points to him sleeping on the sofa alex and constance then exchange sharp words dr brulov tells constance that he knows that jb is quite possibly a murderer the moment i see you with a husband whose pupils are enlarged who has a tremor of the left hand who is on a honeymoon with no baggage and whos name is john brown i know practically what is going on he is going to call the police dr peterson tells him that she knows he must be innocent because i couldnt feel this way toward a man who is bad she couldnt love him if he were guilty dr brulov then mocks her mercilessly you are twenty times crazier than him she couldnt love him if he were no good this is baby talk we both know that the mind of a woman in love is operating on the lowest level of the intellect she finally persuades him to help her cure him and hold off for a few days on calling the policedr brulov awakens jb and begins some rather stern therapy jb has had a dream dr brulov tells him that dreams contain a window into whatever the person is trying to hide but they are in terms of puzzle pieces that are all mixed upwhat follows is the famous dream sequence designed by the renowned abstract impressionist artist salvador dali the dream is full of fantastical images and psychoanalytic symbolism jb is in a gambling casino surrounded by drapes with eyes painted on them the other patrons have blank faces he deals the seven of clubs to a man with a beard who says that he has 21 and has won but the opponents other cards are blank then the proprietor comes over and accuses the bearded man of cheating he says this is my place and if i catch you cheating again ill fix youin the next scene the man with the beard is leaning over the sloping edge of a high building jb yells at him to watch out but he falls over the edge then the proprietor appears from behind a chimney holding a wheel he drops the wheel in the next scene jb is running down a slope with a large winged creature overheadafter relating the dream jb begins to have another episode drs brulov and peterson realize that he saw the view out the window where children are sledding in the snow leaving parallel tracks they realize that the phobia must have arisen from seeing ski tracks and that he must have been skiing with dr edwardesjb begins to recall the ski trip thanks to the clue of the angel wings they piece together that the place was called gabriel valley constance convinces jb against much resistance that he was traumatized by something from his childhood and that they must go to gabriel valley and unlock that secret and figure out what happened to dr edwardesthey go skiing with much apprehension on the part of jb there is a dangerous precipice at the bottom of the hill jb recalls it at the last instant and also recalls a brief incident from his childhood he was sliding down an outdoor banister and accidentally knocked his brother off causing him to be fatally impaled on a fence he stops himself and constance just in time i didnt kill my brother it was an accidenthis memory has returned back at the ski lodge he recalls that his name is john ballantyne he went to columbia medical school was injured in the war and was discharged and treated for nervous shock by dr edwardes they had gone skiing and dr edwardes who was ahead of jb went over the edge to his death he also remembered that prior to the ski trip he had had lunch with dr edwardes at some club in new yorkbut the police have followed them to gabriel valley they found the body of dr edwardes but there was a bullet in him jb is taken away convicted of murder and sent to prisondr peterson goes back to green manors dr brulov visits her and offers his heartfelt sympathy for her loss after he leaves dr murchison who is back as head of the institution also offers his sympathy during their conversation dr murchison lets slip that he knew dr edwardes slightly the words reverberate in dr petersons mind if he knew dr edwardes he would have known instantly that he was an impostor when he arrived at green manors she reaches a devastating conclusion and confronts dr murchison about it she discusses john ballantynes dreamthe casino symbolized both green manors and the restaurant in new york where john had dined with dr edwardes the eyes on the walls were the staff of green manors the card suit and the number 21 indicated that the restaurant was the twentyone club the bearded man playing cards with jb was dr edwardes the man threatening him was dr murchison himself then the most devastating symbol the wheel that he was holding was a revolver dr murchison hid behind a tree shot dr edwardes and dropped the gun the police will be able to trace dr murchison to the twentyone club and gabriel valley and will find the gun with dr murchisons fingerprintsdr murchison then reveals that they wont find the gun there because it is in his desk he pulls it out and threatens to kill dr peterson she slowly walks away he does not kill her and after she has left the room turns the gun around and kills himself the blast from the gun is in bright red the only instant in the movie that isnt in blackandwhitein the final scene constance
