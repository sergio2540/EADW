and makes off with her car before leaving the neighborhood vanessa stops to talk to her boyfriend chopper bokeem woodbine to tell him that she is leaving town to search for the only family member she knows of a distant grandmother who lives in northern california and who doesnt even know vanessa exists chopper gives vanessa his gun and tells her to pawn it for cash as soon as vanessa drives off and is out of sight thugs drive by and shoot the nowdefenseless chopper deadthe stolen car that vanessa is driving breaks down on the local interstate i5 freeway just outside los angeles and a man in an suv pulls over to help her he identifies himself as bob wolverton kiefer sutherland and tells vanessa that the car is not driveable anymore he offers to give vanessa a ride with him and she goes with him in his vehicleafter driving a while bob gets vanessa to open up to him and tell him about her life and she tells him about her broken home her mothers drug abuse and prostitution the violence and abuse that she has encountered in various foster homes and the sexual abusiveness of larry at one point vanessa shows bob a photo she keeps in her wallet of her biological father the photo used is

notorious serial killer known by the press as the i5 killer who has been haunting the freeway and killing innocent young women who walk along itvanessa is afraid but she also becomes infuriated at him for violating the trust she put in him by telling him her life story and bob finds that she is not easily intimidated furthermore vanessa easily identifies the hypocrisy that bob reveals when he identifies vanessa and his other victims as garbage people you act like youre on some kind of mission she tells him but you really just wanna get off in a sex type way the fact that vanessa is so logical and intelligent despite her limited vocabulary and background enrages bob especially when vanessa is more disgusted than afraid when he reveals that he wants to perform sex acts on her body after he kills herusing her quick wit she is able to attack bob and turn the tables on him by diving into the back seat and retrieving choppers gun she forces bob at gunpoint to pull off of the freeway into a desolate area where she explains that bob has proved to her that he is rotten and will only continue to murder women if she does not stop him vanessa shoots bob in the face and is horrified when she must pull the trigger over and over in order to kill him when she thinks he is finally dead she takes his wallet and walks to a nearby diner where the blood all over her clothes alerts everybody that something is wrong she is easily apprehended minutes later by the police who take her into custody meanwhile bob who is not dead after all manages to get to a hospital and get help for his injuriesat a local police station vanessa is questioned by two policemen mike breer wolfgang bodison and garnet wallace dan hedaya at first vanessa is cooperative and freely admits to shooting bob but she is dismayed to learn that she did not kill him although she tells the policemen that bob is the i5 killer they do not believe her after making a background check on vanessa they discover her long criminal record for a variety of crimes from shoplifting to arson and assault and battery while they tell her that bob wolverton is a well known and respected citizen with no criminal record or any history of violence at all furthermore when breer aggressively questions her vanessa reveals a violent temper and she attacks him physically while hurling racial insults at himat her arraignment vanessa refuses to show remorse for her actions insisting to the judge and prosecutor that bob is the i5 killer which falls on deaf ears and when she sees how badly she has wounded bob who is now deformed she reacts with laughter and fury over what he tried to do to her the judge orders vanessa to a juvenile detention center until she can be evaluated for her ability to be tried as an adultwhile in the detention center vanessa meets a sympathetic drugaddicted teen girl named rhonda brittany murphy who befriends vanessa and tries to get her to make out with her vanessa agrees but insists that she will not have sex with rhonda cause im straight another girl a tough latina named mesquita alanna ubach tries to bully vanessa before she can even threaten her vanessa attacks mesquita and bloodies her badly forcing the matrons to lock her in solitary confinement while there she makes a shiv out of a toothbrush to protect herself and plots her escapedays later vanessas guards in the detention center write a report recommending that vanessa be tried as an adult as her chances for rehabilitation seem to be nil meanwhile bob and his straightlaced wife mimi brooke shields are hailed by the media as heroes for persevering after vanessas attack detective breer begins to change his opinion of vanessa after he and wallace interview vanessas peers and learn of how highly she was regarded breer especially is suprised to learn that vanessas deseased boyfriend chopper was black which changes his perspective regarding the racist remarks that vanessa made to him in her moment of anger he returns to the crime scene and finds overlooked evidence that indicates vanessas story may actually be truewhile vanessa mesquita and two other twin girls are being transferred in a van to the state prison vanessa and mesquita escape by launching a violent attack on the guards using vanessas shiv killing one maming another and making off with the van mesquita takes vanessa into her care and gets her a fake id clothes and a gun when they reunite with mesquitas boyfriend she and vanessa share a moment of bonding and mesquita tells vanessa that she only tried to intimidate her so that vanessa would put out for her they laugh and vanessa tells mesquita that shed put out for her any day with that vanessa and mesquita go their seperate waysmeanwhile wallace and breer obtain a search warrant and invade wolvertons home to search for evidence when they unlock a small shed in back of the house they discover all sorts of lurid items including a large stash of child pornography and various trophies from his victims mimi then realizes that her husband really is a serial killer and she suddenly commits suicide in response bob returns home and sees his house surrounded by police cars so he quickly drives off to avoid capture in his earlier encounter with vanessa he had apparently obtained a photo of the grandmother with her address written on the backvanessa uses the clothes that mesquita gave her to pose as a prostitute luring a john into a secluded area and then robbing him at gunpoint after forcing him into his car trunk vanessa drives off in the mans car to where her grandmother lives at the same time wallace and breer figure out where she is going and hope to intercept her before bob can get to herwhen vanessa arrives at her grandmothers home which is actually a trailer in a rundown trailer park lacking the wicker basket that she had with her earlier in the story she finds that bob has killed her and is hiding in her bed while dressed as her after a vicious struggle vanessa kills wolverton by strangling him to death detectives wallace and breer arrive too late to stop the confrontation they eventually enter the trailer to find wolverton and vanessas grandmother both dead and an exhausted and emotionally broken vanessa is beside herself who puts up her hands and surrenders to the two
