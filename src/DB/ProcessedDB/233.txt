to use for private arms trading strannix and his men take over the ships weapon systems for defense shooting down an fa18 hornet sent to investigate and plan on covering their escape by launching a missile strike into honolulu that will obliterate tracking systems in pearl harborryback has become suspicious upon hearing gunfire and tells private nash to contact the ships bridge an annoyed krill realizes they forgot about ryback in the freezer and learns the kitchen is an unsecured area on the ship krill lies to private nash that the noises were not gunshots but party poppers before strannix offhandedly sends mercenaries cates and ziggs to eliminate ryback and nash nash is killed but ryback escapes and kills cates by throwing a knife at him and strangles ziggs then plants a bomb in the microwave to go off later he proceeds to cause havoc amongst the perpetrators and begins killing off the terrorists with the limited help of jordan tate who was only hired as a cover for the festivities ryback also gets in contact with admiral bates andy romano at the pentagon by using a satellite phone whereupon the navy then makes a plan to send a seal team to retake the ship krill discovers that ryback is really a chief petty officer and former navy seal with extensive specialweapons and counterterrorism training he was relegated to his current posting for striking his superior officer who had been responsible for his men being killed in a botched commando mission during the united states invasion of panama as a result he had lost his security clearance and was only able to serve as a yeoman or a cook to keep the missiletheft plan in place krill decides to activate the fire sprinklers in the forecastle leaving the crew members to drown and the terrorists to set up an ambush when ryback arrives presumably by himself to save them however ryback locates a group of sailors in hiding and along with them engages a successful counterstrike turning off the sprinklers dousing the crew and eliminating a considerable number of strannixs forces as strannixs men regroup ryback shuts down the missouris weapon systems in order to allow the incoming navy seal team to landas the battle for the ship continues the submarine crew shoots down both the ch46 helicopter carrying the navy seal team with shoulderfired surfacetoair missiles the pentagon responds by ordering an air strike that will sink the missouri and all aboard strannix regains control of the ships weapon systems and the tomahawks are loaded onto the north korean submarine departing with krill on board with the aid of jordan and his fellow sailors ryback uses the battleships guns which were not yet decommissioned to sink the submarine with krill still inside killing him and every one on boardstrannix standing on the deck suffers a major concussion from being in the proximity of the missouris guns as they are fired he orders the remaining mercenaries out of the control room as he launches two nucleartipped tomahawks towards honolulu as the sailors recapture the ship killing the last group of strannixs men ryback finds his way into the control room where he is caught offguard and captured by strannix strannix and ryback realize they know each other from their past covert experiences but ryback is disgusted by strannixs excuses for his behavior ryback states that both of them are disillusioned and were essentially used by their government but strannix says ryback still believes in his country whereas he does not ryback and strannix then engage in a knife fight wherein ryback kills strannix by poking his eye out stabbing him in the head with his knife and finally smashing him through a computer monitor ryback then takes the launch codes needed to selfdestruct the tomahawk missiles one of the two missiles is destroyed by an fa18 hornet but the other continues on its course the codes are dialed in and the tomahawk missile is deactivated blowing apart before it would have destroyed honolulu the pentagon celebrates wildly then calls off the air assault on the missouriat the end the remaining crew members are freed from their forecastle prison as the ship sails towards san francisco harbor ryback is checked by a navy doctor kisses jordan and the crew looks on and cheers the film ends with a funeral ceremony for captain adams being held on the decks of
