edgar goes outside with his rifle to the meteor crater and then an alien voice tells him to place his projectile weapon on the ground edgar replies you can have my gun after you pry it from my cold dead fingers the alien accepts his proposal and then pulls him screaming into the crater with its large insectoid claw the alien eats him and then climbs out of the crater wearing edgars skin and skull like a suit edgar staggers back into the house with the rifle beatrice asks him what that was but he just asks for sugar she puts a spoonful of sugar into a glass of water but he asks for more sugar until she pours the whole bowl of sugar into the glass he downs it and sighs contentedly she tells him that his skin is hanging off his bones he looks at the mirror and agrees he pulls back his scalp extremely tightening the skin on his face and shows it to her she faints edgar goes back outside and rolls his flying saucer out of the craterback at the police station the police inspector and

that business kay tells him that he hates it when he lies then points his gun at jeebs and counts to three on three kay shoots jeebs causing his head to blow off edwards points his own gun at kay and

tells edgar that he has a pest problem edgar then refers to people as the infestation nothing but an undeveloped unevolved barely conscious pond scum totally convinced of their own superiority as they scurry about their short pointless lives edgar then grabs the exterminator and kills him by forcing his gas pipe down his mouth the man falls to the floor dead gas pouring out of his mouth edgar rolls the saucer into the back of the truckedwards arrives at the mib building and shows the card to the guard who sends him to the elevator upstairs edwards doesnt notice that the elevators back doors open

administering the eye exam to the others with a neuralizer the neuralizer flashes as kay and edwards continue down the hallway edwards opens the folder and sees a photo of an alien standing at the
