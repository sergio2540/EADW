to a low concrete building the men and boys are made to undress supposedly for a shower packed together into a gas chamber and killedin the meantime elsa warns ralf who is in a meeting about increasing the capacity of the crematorium that bruno is missing with gretel they run to the camp and try to find him they find brunos clothes next to the hole under the fence ralf runs throughout the camp and discovers an empty hut and reaching the gas chamber concludes that bruno has been brought to the gas chamber with a group of jews pavel is also seen undressing near the boys and he looks at
