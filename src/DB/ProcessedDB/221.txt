the story was about love faith and confidence a small coastal village in north scotland in 1970sthe village neighborhood didnt like foreigners especially when those people worshiped different religions the public of this village were very pious in undeveloped regions women arent allowed to participate in the funeral ceremonies
the film was the first film of a trilogy the names of which golden heart series the movie was recorded by a handheld camera that brings audiences into the place this technique made the fiction more realistic
the main character was bess who had some mental problems and a childish manner she had to be taken care of by her family members she was talking with herself with a god voice and tried to find a way to endure her pain in the early chapters we saw bess and jan got married had an incredible honeymoon and sexual experience when jan started to work she missed him very much and begged god for the return her husband immediately everything changed with an accident when jan was in the oilrig he injured his neck and completely paralyzed when bess learned the accident first she was very happy but then she started to blame herself their sex relations remained to fall down that situation jan asked her to take a lover and tell him the details because jan knew besss church wouldnt permit divorce what do we think about jans suggestion did he really want to get rid of her for her sake or did he just think about himself i think the story didnt answer this question we should think about a man who was completely paralyzed and became selfish dodo who was besss sisterinlaw said sickness is a mighty power they quarreled about besss situation jan believed bess has more strength than them because of the whole painful process jan attempted to kill himself when he failed he asked dodo for help for his own suicide dodo denied his request she thought the second death would be very damaging for bess bess had recently lost her brother
on the other side bess started to commit adultery she believed in god and convinced herself if she did some sacrifices jan would be able to recovered when she mentioned her bus experience jans reaction was unclearly was he relieved or annoyed i think the most impressive chapter was the sixth one called faith in that chapter she started to go cheap bars and chose the ugliest guys she punished herself that way meanwhile her reputation had become very damaged in the small village only jans doctor and dodo realized her tough condition bess had attempted to seduce the doctor too maybe he also liked her too but didnt want to use her case everyone around her started to become aware of her sinful behavior they even didnt tolerate her attitude her church her neighbors even her mother everyone around her rejected her in those kinds of small villages people can be very cruel about morality which is the biggest sin who are the biggest sinners in this condition social rules are pressure in a small society actually in this story everybody suffered a lot but they pretended to remain innocent while they pushed her down the cliff i think miracles arent always fair they can cause some kind of miserable consequences at the end of the movie the unexpected miracle happened the man recovered but he also lost his wife the villagers wanted to punish her body too they refused to bury her appropriately jan stole the body and gave her a real funeral she buried at sea with the sound of bells
here we have a story which argues what is right or wrong in love if we were bess how many of us could be strong in love  to love a man and never hesitate to do some kind of tough sacrifices 7.9accident love oil-rig scotland sex doctor minister part-of-trilogy nurse christ-figure male-frontal-nudity bliss self-sacrifice melodrama small-town death female-nudity sister-in-law sacrifice husband-wife-relationship funeral faith sexism first-of-series female-frontal-nudity nudity coast spirituality wedding marriage miracle sexuality paralysis hand-camera self-destructiveness redemption coroner religion salvation progressive-rock priest prostitute cripple true-love bigotry sadism crippled sin damnation naivety sailor vicarious-sex hospital grandfather independent-film
