slim pickens peter bull james earl jones tracy reed jack creley frank berry robert oneil glenn beck roy stephens shane rimmer hal galili paul tamarin laurence herder gordon tanner john mccarthy burnell tucker paranoid brigadier general jack d ripper of burpelson air force base he believing that fluoridation of the american water supply is a soviet plot to poison the us populace is able to deploy through a back door mechanism a nuclear attack on the soviet union without the knowledge of his superiors including the chair of the joint chiefs of staff general buck turgidson and president merkin muffley only ripper knows the code to recall the b52 bombers and he has shut down communication in and out of burpelson as a measure to protect this attack rippers executive officer raf group captain lionel mandrake on exchange from britain who is being held at burpelson by ripper believes he knows the recall codes if he can only get a message to the outside world meanwhile at the pentagon war room key persons including muffley turgidson and nuclear scientist and adviser a former nazi named dr strangelove are discussing measures to stop the attack or mitigate its blowup into an all out nuclear war with the soviets against turgidsons wishes muffley brings soviet ambassador alexi de sadesky into the war room and get his boss soviet premier dimitri kisov on the hot line to inform him of whats going on the americans in the war room are dismayed to learn that the soviets have a yet as unannounced doomsday device to detonate if any of their key targets are hit as ripper mandrake and those in the war room try and work the situation to their end goal major tj king kong one of the b52 bomber pilots is working on his own agenda of deploying his bomb where ever he can on enemy soil if he cant make it to his intended target us air force general jack ripper goes completely and utterly mad and sends his bomber wing to destroy the ussr he suspects that the communists are conspiring to pollute the precious bodily fluids of the american people the us president meets with his advisors where the soviet ambassador tells him that if the ussr is hit by nuclear weapons it will trigger a doomsday machine which will destroy all plant and animal life on earth peter sellers portrays the three men who might avert this tragedy british group captain lionel mandrake the only person with access to the demented gen ripper us president merkin muffley whose best attempts to divert disaster depend on placating a drunken soviet premier and the former nazi genius dr strangelove who concludes that such a device would not be a practical deterrent for reasons which at this moment must be all too obvious will the bombers be stopped in time or will general jack ripper succeed in destroying the world  us president merkin muffley is on the hot line to moscow with some rather embarrassing news for the soviet premier hello dimitriim finenow then you know how weve always talked about the possibility of something going wrong with the bombthe bomb dimitri the hydrogen bombwell now what happened is that uh one of our base commandershe went a little funny in the headand he went and did a silly thinghe ordered his planes to attack your country a comedy about an accidental nuclear attack one that ends with total annihilation thermonuclear apocalypse preposterous stanley kubrick thought otherwise in the end his thinking prevailed the mad saga revolves around a psychotic strategic air command officer gen jack d ripper who lets loose his b52 bomber squadron on the soviet union ripper takes this unilateral action because of his paranoid belief that communists are sapping and contaminating all our precious bodily fluids as part of their plan to take over the world unbeknownst to ripper his attack will trigger the russians ultimate weapon the doomsday machine a diabolical retaliatory device set to blow up the planet at the burpelson us air force base somewhere in the continental usa the eccentric brigadier general jack d ripper sterling hayden orders the 34 nucleararmed b52s of the 843rd bomb wing past their failsafe points where they normally hold awaiting possible orders to proceed and into soviet airspace he also tells the personnel on the base that the us and the ussr have entered into a shooting warin the war room at the pentagon air force general buck turgidson george c scott briefs president merkin muffley peter sellers about the attack that general ripper ordered although a nuclear attack should require presidential authority to be initiated ripper used plan r an emergency war plan enabling a senior officer to launch a retaliation strike against the soviets if everyone in the normal chain of command including the president has been killed during a sneak attack plan r was intended to discourage the soviets from launching a decapitation strike against the president in washington to disrupt us command and control and stop an american nuclear counterattack turgidson tries to convince muffley to take advantage of the situation to eliminate the soviets as a threat by launching a fullscale attack turgidson believes that the united states is in a superior strategic position and a first strike against the soviet union would destroy 90 of their missiles before they could retaliate resulting in a victory for the us with acceptable american casualties of no more than 10 to 20 million killed tops depending on the breaks he is rebuked when muffley instead admits the soviet ambassador peter bull to the war room contacts soviet premier dmitri kissoff on the hotline and insists on giving the soviets all the information necessary to shoot down the american planes before they can carry out their strikesgroup captain lionel mandrake also played by peter sellers an raf exchange officer serving as general rippers executive officer realizes that there has been no attack on the us when he turns on a radio and hears pop music instead of civil defense alerts when mandrake reveals this to ripper and ripper refuses to recall the wing mandrake announces that he will issue the recall on his own authority but only ripper knows the threeletter code necessary for recalling the bombers and locks the two of them in his office mandrake tries to convince ripper to give up the three letter code the psychotic ripper refuses and rambles on that the communists have a plan to sap and impurify the precious bodily fluids of the american people with fluoridated water a theory that occurred to him during sexual intercourse and which he believed to be the cause of his postcoital fatigueover the phone an unseen and drunken kissoff reveals to the soviet ambassador that their country has installed an active doomsday device which will automatically destroy all human and animal life on earth if a nuclear attack were to hit the soviet union the doomsday device is operated by a network of computers and has been conceived as the ultimate deterrent as a safeguard it cannot be deactivated or it will set itself off because its hardware and programs have been configured in such a way that an attempt at its deactivation would be recognized as sabotage the doomsday weapon is described as based on cobaltthoriumg this was inspired by the real idea of a cobalt bomb conceived by nuclear pioneer leo szilard founder of council for a livable world according to the soviet ambassador life on earths surface will be extinct in ten months and was made as a low cost alternative to the bombracethe president now calls upon dr strangelove aka merkwürdigeliebe a former nazi and strategy expert sellers in his third role the wheelchairbound strangelove is a type of mad scientist whose eccentricities include a severe case of alien hand syndrome so that his right hand clad in an ominous black leather glove occasionally attempts to strangle strangelove or make the nazi salute no one in the room acts if this is unsusual strangelove also slips in addressing the president as either mein president or even mein führerstrangelove explains the principles behind the doomsday device which he says is simple to understand credible and convincing he also points out that a doomsday device kept secret has no value as a deterrent the soviet ambassador admits that his government had installed it a few days before they were going to announce it publicly to the world because kissoff loves surprisesus army paratroopers sent by the president arrive at burpelson to arrest general ripper because ripper has warned his men that the enemy might attack disguised as american soldiers the bases security forces and ripper himself with a 50 caliber m1919 browning machine gun kept in his golf bag open fire on them after a fierce firefight the army forces win the battle and gain access to the base and ripper fearing torture to extract the recall code commits suicide colonel bat guano keenan wynn shoots his way into rippers office but suspects that mandrake whose uniform he does not recognize is leading a mutiny of deviated preverts and proceeds to arrest him mandrake convinces guano that he has to call the president to tell him the recall code which he has deduced from rippers desk blotter doodles to be based on the initials for the phrases peace on earth and purity of essence since office phone connections had been knocked out by the fighting at the base mandrake is forced to use a pay phone to try to contact the president not having the correct change to place a longdistance call to the pentagon mandrake persuades guano to shoot a cocacola vending machine to get the change out of it and eventually is able to forward the likely code combinations to strategic air commandthe correct recall code ope is issued to the planes and those that have not been shot down return to base except for one its radio and fuel tanks were damaged by a soviet antiaircraft missile with the result that the plane is neither able to receive the recall code nor to reach its primary or secondary target where at the urging of the us president the soviets have concentrated all available defenses on the crews own initiative and losing fuel the plane proceeds to fly at low level under radar to a closer target of opportunityas they start their bomb run the damaged b52s bomb bay doors will not open and aircraft commander major t j king kong slim pickens goes down to the bomb bay to open them himself he succeeds just as the plane reaches its target and one of the nuclear bombs falls with kong still sitting on it he straddles the bomb and rides it to the ground like a rodeo cowboy whooping and hollering and waving his cowboy hat the bomb explodes triggering the doomsday machineback in the war room dr strangelove recommends to the president that a select group of about 200000 or more people be relocated into a deep mine shaft where the nuclear fallout cannot reach them so that the us can be repopulated afterwards because of space limitations strangelove suggests a gender ratio of ten females to each male with the women selected for their sexual characteristics and the men selected on the basis of their physical strength intellectual capabilities and importance in business and government general turgidson rants that the soviets will likely create an even better bunker than the us and argues that america must not allow a mine shaft gap meanwhile the soviet ambassador retreats to a corner of the war room and starts taking pictures with a spy camera disguised as a pocket watcha visibly excited dr strangelove bolts out of his wheelchair shouting mein führer i can walk abruptly the film ends with a barrage of nuclear explosions accompanied by vera lynns famous world war ii
