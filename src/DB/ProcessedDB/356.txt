man says he is jerome clifford attorney at law but he says that since theyre both pretty tight to just call him romy as hes talking mark notices a gun lying between them mark asks jerome why hes trying to kill himself he responds that if he doesnt kill himself his client barry the blade muldano will because jerome knows where the body of boyd boyett a man the blade killed is buried he tells mark where it is but we cant hear what he says he says the body is still there and no one will ever find it mark suddenly picks up the gun and points it at jerome jerome encourages mark to pull the trigger but jerome cant do it jerome takes the gun away and says lets see if it works he shoots the gun near marks head and mark escapes from the car he takes ricky and runs as jerome chases after them yelling if the blade finds out what you know hes going to kill you anyway he stops puts the gun in his mouth and pulls the trigger ricky sees the entire act and is severely traumatized mark takes

takes mark to rickys room the doctor says ricky has post traumatic stress disorder and is in a coma as he continues to talk mark sees sergeant hardy putting marks sprite can in a plastic bag mark runs after him but the officer is already in the elevator smirking mark wanders into a waiting room where he finds a flier for a law firm on the groundback with roy foltrigg his people are telling him marks story and they dont believe it because they found marks fingerprints all over the car roy deduces that jerome must have told mark where the body is and thats why hes lying he demands to speak with mark right away mark goes to the law firm in his flier and finds lawyer regina reggie love susan sarandon hes reluctant to have her represent him before he has to talk with the fbi and mr foltrigg because shes a woman but shes interested in his case because she has a grudge against roy he says he doesnt know why hes being harassed just because he saw some sweaty fat guy commit suicide reggie asks why he lied to the police and told them he just found jerome he says he didnt lie and reggie tells him that dead men dont sweat he admits that he did see jerome alive before he killed himself but doesnt tell her he talked to him reggie agrees to take his case and mark pays her a dollarmeanwhile in new orleans the blade is getting scolded by his boss uncle johnny for telling jerome too much and says the kids might know too much now as well so he tells the blade to move the body just in case not able to trust barry uncle johnny sends another hit man rocky to take care of the kids back with mark roy and his people are interrogating mark he asks if he needs a lawyer before talking to him and they tell him no he gives them the run around until roy flat out asks him about the body and to that mark demands to go the the bathroom eventually reggie returns accusing them of unlawful interrogation which they deny but reggie plays a tape of their conversation catching them all in a lie roy insists that he has proof mark is lying and was in the car with jerome but reggie accuses him of hypocrisywhen reggie leaves she begins speaking with marks mother who begins telling reggie about her dreams and how all she ever wanted was a white house and walkin closet later reggie is trying to get the truth out of mark but mark insists he was not in jeromes car reggie eventually leaves mark in the waiting room where a man hired by rocky to get close to mark gives mark candy and begins to talk with him prying for information mark notices something isnt right and leaves late that night mark goes to get something to eat but is held at knife point by rocky in the elevator rocky threatens mark not to talk to the fbi or hell be killed the next day mark goes to reggie and refuses to talk to the fbi before reggie can say much shes notified that roy and the fbi are on their way mark hides while reggie talks to them they have proof that marks story is not true this flusters reggie but she manages to stay calm by pointing out that they illegally obtained evidence and shell expose mr foltrigg if they go near mark again his illegal actions wouldnt look good for a man running for governor of louisiana mr foltrigg reveals that reggie was once in rehab this shocks mark reggie manages to get rid of them and infuriated confronts mark about his lies mark accuses her of being the liar fires her and storms out she follows him and he jumps in her car upon seeing the media circus outside of the hospitalreggie goes to her house but mark demands to be taken back the

waiting room afraid he runs to reggies house hes angry at first but reggie gets him to talk to her mark reveals that his father used to get drunk and beat him and his mother which is why he was so mad when he found out about reggies past reggie begins talking about her children and exhusband until mark feels comfortable enough to tell her the whole truth including rockys threat reggie alarmed begins to call to get mark someplace safe outside rocky and two other hit men talk about going in killing reggie and kidnapping mark one of them has an idea and they burn marks trailer as a warning instead marks mother hears the news at the hospital and having lost her job as well is devastated she yells at reggie and tells her mark already has a mother and kicks her out of the room after reggie leaves the police come to take mark into custody until he talks to the fbi in custody mark asks for a phone to call his mother and prank orders pizzas to the police department meanwhile reggie is trying to get mark out she talks to a friend of hers about getting mark to talk only if he and his family can get into the witness protection program afterwards shes frustrated when they cant guarantee it to her but gets mark out to talk anyway mark says whatever he does he could get killed anyway and she cant let them ask any questions she cant promise him anything but says he cant lie if they do get him on the standin court roy and the fbi brow beat mark to talk but reggie diverts them any way she can eventually they get mark on the stand and struggle to get information but he eventually pleads the fifth and decides hed rather go back to jail until everything is sorted out than risk he and his familys life meanwhile the blade is meeting with uncle johnny and they decide mark has gotten too close to talking and he must be killed back at the jail mark is found on the ground barely conscious soaked in sweat and heart beating extremely rapidly they rush him to the

a post traumatic stress attack in order to escape from jail reggie says shes coming to pick him upreggie manages to sneak mark in her car and mark says hes thinking about witness protection now but jerome was drunk so the body may not be where he said reggie says they have to know where the body is before mark gets any protection mark convinces reggie they have to go to new orleans and make sure the body is where romy said it was under romys own boat in romys boat house reggie is very reluctant but agrees meanwhile the blade is asking uncle johnny once again for permission to move the body now that mark has escaped uncle johnny agrees but says this is the blades last chance reggie calls her brother from a hotel in new orleans to tell him what shes up to unaware that mr foltrigg is tracking her call they go after herlater reggie and mark find romys boat house which is located next to some rather paranoid and securityridden neighbors mark manages to crawl through a high window into the boat house leaving reggie behind at the bottom little do they know that the blade and rocky have arrived at the same place the hit men make their way into the boat house while mark hurriedly hides in romys covered boat to get the body the men raise the boat up reggie scared for mark climbs quietly to the open window to see if hes okay mark looks down from under the cover while the men uncover the body reggie gets marks attention and begs him to sneak back out through the window after a while he sees the body and finally tries to climb up to the window where reggie pulls him through they make a noise which the blade hears and when he looks up he sees reggie and mark looking trying to escape they run and the blade goes after them he eventually catches reggie and his gun goes flying in the struggle reggie tells mark to run but mark picks up the gun and tells the blade to let reggie go he holds the blade at gunpoint seriously considering shooting him but reggie convinces mark to hand the gun over to her the blade teases reggie saying she doesnt have the guts and should have let mark shoot reggie scoffs and instead shoots a security box on the neighbors house setting off alarms the neighbors come out making a fuss and mark and reggie get away while the neighbors shoot at the blade and the other hit men the hit men shoot back at the neighbors who retreat and the hit men leave before the police can arrive mark goes back to the boat house to find the garbage bag thats supposed to contain boyd boyetts body he opens it to see if hes in there and is assaulted with the sight of maggots an awful smell and the bodythe next day reggie meets with roy in a new orleans diner roy is anxious to find out the whereabouts of the body but reggie will only tell him if he
