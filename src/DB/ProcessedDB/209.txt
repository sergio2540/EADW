crisis culminating in the infamous affair of the eighteeninchhigh stonehenge stage prop british heavy metal band spinal tap embarks on their biggest tour in the us to date to promote their new album smell the glove the tour is so big that its attracted the attention of documentary filmmaker marti debergi who decides to make a movie about spinal taps trek across america but as the documentary goes along spinal tap sees their audiences dwindle from selling out huge arenas to going to play at charity benefits and eventually playing private parties where no one pays attention to their music their new album drops and its decently reviewed by critics but the record stores have a huge problem with the sexist overtones of the albums cover causing a loss in sales however a series of incidents that constantly shoot themselves in the foot  whether its a minuscule stonehenge monument a stage prop malfunction or a simple two word review of an album  keep preventing the band from enjoying the success they deserve but how long can they keep playing to 11 and will they find the audience that suits them marty debergi is a filmmaker who decides to make a documentary a rockumentary actually about the worlds loudest band the british heavy metal group spinal tap the movie is in fact a biting satire and spoof of the whole rock and roll scene that passes itself off as a real documentary of a real band hilarious behindthescenes footage is combined with fauxconcert clips to breathe life into the imaginary group neophyte director marty dibergi rob reiner presents this rockumentary showcasing the north american tour of aging rockers spïnal tap band members david st hubbins michael mckean nigel tufnel christopher guest and derick smalls harry shearer form the core of the group with various drummers dying over the years in freak accidents or through spontaneous human combustion the band is set to promote their new record smell the glove featuring a degrading photograph of a woman in bondage smelling a glove the cover is deemed too offensive for many chain stores and is redone in 100 black lacking a band logo or even a titletheir first gig is a huge success selling out new york citys madison square garden before the tour begins their promoter holds a huge party for the band as theyve successfully completed their latest record smell the glove the record company ceo toasts spinal taps success by tapping into the millenium which coincidentally is the name of their tournext theyre being interviewed by marty dibergi we learn the history of spinal tap from the beginning of the bands origins through the present day it seems that theyve gone through a number of lineup changes and drummers  one spontaneously combusted while another choked on his own vomitspinal tap is being transported to their next gig and to pass the time theyre reading the autobiography of rat pack member sammy davis jr the limo driver has a onesided conversation with them about frank sinatras history the next song being played is their smash hit single big bottom we also learn how spinal taps back catalog was received by critics most of the albums received rather mixed reviews but one album called shark sandwich received just a two word review  shit sandwich their religious rock album the gospel according to spinal tap was also rather poorly receivedtheir next stop takes them to atlanta for the recording industry convention there they learn a couple of gigs were canceled but nothing to be worried about while there theyre presented with the finished copies of their new album but are completely shocked that its all black it appears that the record label marketing department was completely offended by the proposed cover as stores have said they flat out werent going to sell the album citing it as filth spinal taps promoters get into a huge argument with the record label ceo who cites their album cover as sexistwhile backstage for their next gig in chapel hill north carolina nigel is complaining about the quality or complete lack thereof of the food being presented to them he tells the manager that its a complete catastrophe and that they wouldnt like being served that food either the next song they play is hell hole which is rather well received by the theater crowd during the song david gets in a rather tense guitar solo and falls to the ground requiring roadies to pick him up the next day marti is going over nigels massive amounts of equipment that they transport from show to show he then explains how their amplifiers dont end at 10 they go to 11 which is one louder their next gig in charlotte proves to be another disaster when their gig is cancelled due to a lack of advertising fundsthe next interview with marti we learn that spinal tap has a dwindling audience at the start of last years tour they were booked into 10000 and 15000 seat arenas now theyre being booked into 4000 and 6000 seat arenas they proceed to take out their frustrations by destroying their hotel room as nigel is on the phone to their promoter they learn that a number of their gigs across the midwest have been cancelled but thankfully theyre saved when derek informs them that a song they recorded in the past called listen to the flower people was being played on the local radio but their happiness is short lived when the announcer refers to them in the where are they now segmentthankfully spinal tap has managed to secure a gig in memphis there they pay tribute to elvis presley by making a stop at graceland and singing heartbreak hotel though none of the band members can remember the words nor sing in harmony spinal taps first single was released in 1968 and theyve been a band ever since and evolving with the times and trends though the recent times have not been kind to them we also learn of another drummer that died a mysterious death  this one spontaneously combusted on stageat their next gig in milwaukee they play a sound check where they play another song from their flower people era called give me some money theyre finally presented with a box of copies of smell the glove where theyre stunned to learn that the studio has decided to go with their decision to release the album cover in all black instead of the proposed and very controversial cover their next song is called rock and roll creation and derek gets trapped in his pod during the entire song and the roadies desperately try to free him with no successthe next interview with marti dibergi interviews spinal taps drummer there he asks whether or not the history of spinal tap drummers has him afraid of what might happen to him he says its no big deal on the tour bus to their next gig the band throws a huge partyspinal tap manages to secure their next gig in denver unfortunately as the crowd is demanding they play they get lost making their way to the stage repeatedly the next gig in albequerque proves to be particularly embarrassing as the only gig theyve managed to secure has them opening for a magician at a rich kids birthday party this causes a rift in the bandthe next gig all hell breaks loose they play one of their most famous songs  a tribute to the ancient stonehenge monument in northern england complete with dwarf dancers and live props the live prop happens to be a life size replica of stonehenge according to nigels design unfortunately thanks to a typo the stonehenge monument actually appears much smaller than he originally specified this proves to be a huge disasterand things only get worse from there their next gig takes them to san diego and the miramar air force base where theyre the entertainment for a huge reception with a major us admiral unfortunately the crowd isnt interested and the band loses interest as well a frustrated nigel finally walks out on the band and then their last gig on the us tour is their worst to date as theyre opening for a puppet show at the zoo but spinal tap isnt done yet  fortunately their music and their new album prove to be a huge hit in japan upon hearing the news nigel reunites with the group and they begin a tour of japanfinally at the groups last show nigel reappears with a message from ian the single sex farm is a big hit in japan and promoters would be interested in booking the band for a tour there spïnal tap is thus reborn even as another drummer
