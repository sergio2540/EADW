george i wouldnt expect you to drive the bus to a ku klux klan meeting george becomes confrontational and angrily accuses rick of being a racist for not supporting the march in spite of farrakhans own racist remarks against both white and jewish people while at the same time refusing to acknowledge that farrakhan ever made them although rick maintains that he is not a racist george refuses to accept this george begrudgingly agrees to disagree with rick and lets him depart although he refuses to look at rick when rick wants to shake his hand before he leaves george drives the bus for the
