outside something hits the fence and shorts it out the security team checks the breach but finds nothing a series of foot like depressions begin forming leading to the ship something unseen enters the ship a scream echos through the compoundback at the morbius residence he argues that only he should be allowed to control the flow of krell technology back to earth in the middle of the discussion adams is paged and told that the chief quinn has been murdered adams breaks of his discussions and heads back to the shiplater that night doc finds the footprints and makes a cast the foot makes no evolutionary sense it seems to have elements of a four footed and biped creature also it seems a predator and herbivore adams questions cookie who was with the robot during the test and decides the robot was not responsiblethe next day at the funeral for chief morbius again warns him of impending doom facing the ship and crew adams considers this a challenge and spends the day fortifying the position around the ship after testing the weapons and satisfied all that could be done has the radar station suddenly reports movement in the distance moving slowly towards the shipno one sees anything despite the weapons being under radar fire control the controller confirms a direct hit but the object is still moving towards the ship suddenly something hits the force field fence and a huge monster appears outlined in the energy flux the crew open fire but seem to do little good a number of men move forward but a quickly killedmorbious wakes hearing the screams of altair shes had a dream mimicking the attack that has just occurred as morbious is waking the creature in the force field disappears doc theories that the creature is made of some sort of energy renewing itself second by secondadams takes doc in the tractor to visit morbius intending to evacuate him from the planet he leaves orders for the ship to be readied for lift off if he and doc dont get back the ship is to leave without them they also want to try and break into morbious office and take the brain booster testthey are met at the door by robby who disarms them altair appears and countermands the orders given to robby by her father seeing a chance doc sneaks into the office altair argues with adams about trying to make morbius return home she ultimately declares her love for himrobby appears carrying the injured doc struggling to speak and heavy pain doc explains that the krell succeeded in their great experiment however they forgot about the sub conscious monsters they would release monsters from the idmorbius sees the dead body of doc and makes a series of ugly comments his daughter reminds him that doc is dead morbius lack of care convinces altair she is better off going with adams morbius tries to talk adams out of taking altairadams demands an explanation of the id morbius realizes he is the source of the creature killing everyone the machine the krell built was able to release his inner beast the sub conscious monster dwelling deep inside his ancestral mindrobby interrupts the debate to report something approaching the house morbius triggers the defensive shields of the house which the creature begins to destroy morbius then orders robby to destroy the creature however robby short circuits adams explained that it was useless robby knew it was morbius selfadams altair and morbius retreat to the krell lab and sealed themselves in by sealing a special indestructible door adams convinces morbius that he is really the monster and that morbius can not actually control his subconscious desiresthe group watch as the creature beings the slow process of burning through the door panicked morbius implores altair to say it is not so suddenly the full realization comes and he understands that he could endanger or even kill altairas the creature breaks through morbius rushes forward and denies its existence suddenly the creature disappears but morbius is mortally wounded with his dying breath he instructs adams to trigger a self destruct mechanism linked to the reactors of the great machine the ship and crew have 24 hours to get as far away from the planet as possiblethe next day we see the ship deep in space robby and altair are onboard watching as the planet brightens and is destroyed adams assures altair that her fathers memory will shine like a beacon
