city to replace the rotting city of detroit unfortunately the inhabitants of the area have no intention of abandoning their homes simply for desires of the company to this end ocp have decided to force them to leave by employing a ruthless mercenary army to attack and harass them an underground resistance begins and in this fight robocop must decide where his loyalties lie omni consumer products ocp begins its plan for the creation of delta city as part of this program a special rehab squad leaded by commander paul mcdaggett is deployed as they evacuate the city in a forced manner tearing down part of the city in this chaos a young girl named nikko is left alone and picked up by a group of citizens joining together to strike on ocp first raiding a police department armory warehouse murphy is sent to the chase of this group but he eventually ignored the order when he received a back up call from anne lewis and the other officers who were attacked by a group of cyber punks this violation leads to the decision of finally cutting murphys past memories for good as he finds himself between the line of law enforcement and popular opinion when the law is beginning to be corrupted and he is betrayed by the law he sought to uphold when lewis is killed and he is left for dead all of this thanks to directive 4 any attempt to arrest an officer of ocp results in shut down at the same time the new younger ceo of ocp begins relations with a japanese cybernetics corporation leaded by a man named kanemitsu for monetary support leading into the deployment of the advanced android otomo a fully skilled ninja with full human appearance but still a machine slowly as all of detroit joins the motor citys cause including the police department mcdaggett sees use for the arrested criminals to create his own army of criminals to strike down the citys militia once and for all the only hope murphy overcoming the control placed on him by directive 4 and bring down this corrupted plan some time after robocop put an end to the nuke production things have changed dramatically thereafter ocps ceo known as the old man is gone and their delta city project has begun but not before ocp was bought out by the japanese robotic company known as kanemitsu they have formulated their own police force who are flushing people out of their homes and send them to ocps special rehabilitation program however a little girl named nikko had escaped from the program and is now with a group of rebels then robocop and his partner anne lewis see activity at a church where the ocp force led by a man named paul mcdagget is about to wipe out the rebels until robocop was heavily damaged by mcdaggets forces and killed lewis meanwhile the new ceo of ocp has just receive notice that kanemitsu will help with the construction of delta city as they sent their own parthuman partrobot to assist ocp named otomo when the rebels repaired robocop he starts to find mcdagget now robocop
