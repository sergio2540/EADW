butch is all ideas sundance is all action and skill the west is becoming civilized and when butch and sundance rob a train once too often a special posse begins trailing them no matter where they run over rock through towns across rivers the group is always just behind them when they finally escape through sheer luck butch has another idea lets go to bolivia based on the exploits of the historical characters in the turn of the century american west robert leroy parker and harry longabaugh are better known by their aliases butch cassidy and the sundance kid partners and arguably the most renowned outlaws in the area they who hold up banks or trains within the partnership butch is the brains sundance the shooting brawn despite their outlaw status they are seen as an affable duo by those that know them even by many of their so called adversaries butch has compiled the hole in the wall gang named after his hideout in the wyoming mountains and is its de facto leader primarily because he was the one who brought them all together but as time goes on butch and sundance are finding that changing circumstances are making their work more and more difficult which leads to others within the gang questioning butchs leadership following one of the gangs jobs holding up a train a posse of six men on horseback are after them not the gang as a whole but rather only butch and sundance the duo have to figure who the six men are to find out their end goal in trying to get away they are assisted by their friend schoolteacher etta place who is officially sundances girlfriend

the famous hole in the wall gang are planning another bank robbery as they return to their hideout in holeinthewall they find out that the gang has selected a new leader harvey logan he challenges butch to a knife fight which butch wins using a ruse logan had the idea to rob the union pacific flyer train instead of banks he wanted to rob it twice the idea being that the return would be considered safe and therefore more money might be involved butch takes this idea as his ownthe first robbery goes very well and the marshal of the next town cant manage to raise a posse butch and sundance listen to his attempts enjoying themselves sundances lover etta place katherine ross is introduced but obviously both men vie for her attention as she also goes bikeriding with butch a dialoguefree part of the film accompanied by raindrops keep falling on my headthe second robbery goes wrong not only does butch use too much dynamite to blow the safe but also a second train arrives which is carrying a posse of six heavily armed men on horseback that has been specially outfitted to hunt butch and sundance down the gang flees but the entire posse follows butch and sundance they try hiding in a brothel in a nearby town that night but are betrayed when they find out the posse is continuing to follow their trail they try riding double on a single horse in the hope that the posse will split up but that fails they then arrive in a nearby town and try to arrange an amnesty with the help of a friendly sheriff jeff corey of carbon county but the sheriff tells them they have no chance of getting one and that they will be hunted down until they are killed by the possestill on the run the next day they muse about the identities of their pursuers they fixate on lord baltimore a famous indian tracker and joe lefors a tough renowned lawman identifiable by his white skimmer hat which the lead posse member is wearing after climbing some mountains they suddenly find themselves trapped on the edge of a canyon with their unseen persuers on their tail they decide to jump into the river far below even though sundance cant swim and would prefer to fightlater that day they arrive at ettas house and learn from the local newspapers all about the posse and the identities of their persuers and that they have been paid to stay together until they kill butch and the kid

world sundance already resents the choice their first attempted bank robbery stops before it gets off the ground as they are unable to speak or understand spanish etta teaches them the words they need their next robbery is clumsily executed as butch still needs his cribsheet after each robbery they seem to get better until they are sought by the authorities all over boliviahowever their confidence drops as one evening when butch sundance and etta are having dinner at a fancy restaurant in a nearby town when they see a man wearing a white straw hat standing on the other side of the street talking to a few men fearing that lefors is once again after them butch suggests going straight so as to not attract lefors attentionthey get their first honest job as payroll guards in a mine directed by an american named garris strother martin however on their first working day they are attacked by highwaymen garris is killed and butch and sundance are forced to kill the bolivian robbers
