the city of los angeles their weapons fail to penetrate the crafts force field and it responds by releasing scores of smaller attacker ships which are similarly shielded and armed with highenergy torpedos onesided dogfights ensue captain steven hiller will smith manages to evade the guns of the attacker ships and lures a single attacker to the grand canyon there as his jet is about out of fuel and the attacker is about to overtake him he deploys the landing chute for his jet and it drapes across the alien craft temporarily disorienting the pilot captain hiller then ejects from his jet the alien crash lands in the desert and captain hiller parachutes to a landing close by he then angrily marches over to find and confront whatever life form it is he might encounter the door to the alien fighter craft pops open and a very bizarre looking creature with many tentacles appears captain hiller delivers a right cross and knocks the creature out captain hiller says now thats what i call a close encounteras hiller is using his parachute to drag the body of the alien across the desert he is picked up by russell casse randy quaid who is traveling across the desert with a group of refugees

operating room its first words are release me president whitmore poses a question to the alien cant we live in peace the creature says no when the president asks the creature what it wants them to do it responds die it then uses its telepathic powers to immobilize the president and fling him to the ground the military personnel with the president then shoot the alien through the glass with major mitchell stepping through the broken glass and delivering a final head shotduring the instant that president whitmore was immobilized he said he was sharing the thoughts of the alien he learned that the aliens have done this before they attack planets use up the resources kill the life forms then move on president whitmore now issues very clear orders to nuke the bastardsb2 spirit bombers are deployed with the first destroyer targeted one that is hovering over a deserted houston tx that weapon explodes but proves ineffective at penetrating the crafts force field and destroys the city instead as a result the president orders the remaining bombers called backpresident whitmore and his daughter are reunited with the first lady marilyn whitmore mary mcdonnell at area 51 mrs whitmore

his decisions and actions president whitmore physically pushes him and fires him on the spotdavid levinson suggests a plan that involves using the newly operable attacker to gain access to the interior of the alien mothership in space in order to introduce a computer virus that will disable the protective shields around the destroyers and attackers once the computer virus took effect nuclear weapons would be used to destroy the mothership hiller volunteers to be pilot the attacker with levinson accompanying him to upload the viruswith satellite communications knocked out the americans have used morse code to coordinate an attack with the remaining forces around the world timed to occur when the invaders shields are set to fail with not enough military pilots to man all available aircraft the battle requires several volunteers including president whitmore and russell who both have previous combat flight experiencehiller and levinson successfully reach the mothership and implant the virus president whitmore leads the american jet fighters against the alien destroyer that is approaching area 51 although the aliens now lack shields the fighters supply of missiles are quickly exhausted against the colossal craft and its large complement of assault ships the underside of the alien craft opens up as its directed energy weapon prepares to fire on the base russell possesses the last remaining missile but his firing mechanism jams he decides to pilot his aircraft into the alien weapon in a kamikaze attack the explosion causes a chain reaction which annihilates the ship human resistance forces around the world use the same weak point to destroy the remainder of the alien ships while the nuclear device planted by hiller and levinson destroys the alien mothership soon after the duo escape hiller and levinson are caught up in the aftereffects of the motherships explosion but are able to return to earth unharmed crashlanding the alien fighter in the
