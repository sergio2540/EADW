since the first cyborg called the terminator tried to kill sarah connor and her unborn son john connor john connor the future leader of the human resistance is now a healthy young boy however another terminator is sent back through time called the t1000 which is more advanced and more powerful than its predecessor the mission to kill john connor when hes still a child however sarah and john do not have to face this threat of a terminator alone another terminator is also sent back through time the mission to protect john and sarah connor at all costs the battle for tomorrow has begun nearly 10 years have passed since sarah connor was targeted for termination by a cyborg from the future now her son john the future leader of the resistance is the target for a newer more deadly terminator once again the resistance has managed to send a protector back to attempt to save john and his mother sarah sequel to terminator skynet the 21st century computer waging a losing war on humans sends a second terminator back in time to destroy the leader of the human resistance while he is still a boy his mother is the only one who knows of the existence of the terminators humanlike robots that exist only to kill and are nearly indestructible and sarah the boys mother is currently in a state mental hospital because of her delusions a second protector is sent back to the past by the human resistance to protect john connor their future leader at all costs in the year 2029 a computer called skynet is fighting against a human resistance after having nearly destroyed the rest of humanity in 1997 skynet has found a way to send some of its warriors called terminators back in time this is the story of the terminator sent to kill the resistance leader in 1995 while he is still a child the resistance sends a reprogrammed terminator back to 1995 to protect the young man the question is can they survive against the new prototype liquid metal terminator while preventing the creation of skynet it has been ten long years since a terminator failed to kill sarah connor and her unborn son john now skynet has sent back another terminator this one being more advanced than the last one john connor who is now ten years old is the target the future john sends back a replica of the terminator that tried to kill him back in time to 1995 its terminator vs terminator in the last movie a cyborg was sent from the future to kill sarah connor but he failed now a much more powerful one sent from the future to kill sarahs son  john connor the leader of the future rebels a terminator was send from the future once more but this time to protect connor the only problem is that the terminator who was send to kill connor is much more powerful and clever than the one who was send to protect him moreover none can help connor since they do not believe in robots now connor and his protector has no choice but to survive on their own scenes described in red text appear only in the special edition of terminator 2 judgment dayproduction credits appear in shots of traffic lines and children playing in playgrounds the shot starts to fade into blue as the sounds of childrens voices die out followed by a flashforward to los angeles in 2029 ad the world has become a wasteland of wrecked cars destroyed buildings and blackcharred playgrounds filled with skeletons and skulls the voice of sarah connor linda hamilton narrates 3 billion human lives ended on august 29th 1997 the survivors of the nuclear fire called the war judgment day they only lived to face a new nightmare the war against the machinesthe foot of a metallic android smashes a skull on the ground a battle is starting between human guerrilla troops and a technically far superior robotic army crushing skulls beneath their tracks robotic tanks open a fullfrontal assault on the humans who are trained to make use of what shelter the ruined terrain offers them flying aircraft search the ground for targets as t800 androids sweep the terrain at places the tanks cannot access although they suffer heavy losses the humans manage to destroy several tanks aircraft and androids they even use old cars as crude assault vehicles but the machines lasers are accurate and unrelentinga man is saluted by his soldiers as he crosses a destroyed hallway and inspects the battlefield from a safe distance the camera zooms in on his scarred face as sarahs voiceover continues skynet the computer that controlled the machines sent two terminators back through time their mission to destroy the leader of the human resistance john connor my son the first terminator was programmed to strike at me in the year 1984 before john was born it failed the second was set to strike at john himself when he was just a child the closeup of john connor dissolves into a blaze of inferno as sarah continues as before the resistance was able to send a lone warrior as a protector for john it was just a question of which one would reach him firstthe opening credits start playing in a montage of shots of playgrounds burning in an inferno the credits end as the camera zooms in on the metal face of a terminator through the fire until its red glowing eyes are in extreme closeupcut back to present day a truck starts its engine and drives away from a truck stop where a wind suddenly starts to blow and electric charges fill the air out of nowhere a brightlylit orb appears cutting out parts from the ground and a nearby truck the orb dissolves leaving a crouching naked man in its place as the electrical charges slowly fade the man arnold schwarzenegger rises to his feet it is a terminator same appearance as the one that got sent through time in the terminator to kill sarah connor we see its red pointofview processing screen as it approaches a biker bar called the corral and inspects the motorcycles in front of it before it enters through the doorinside the poolplaying and drinking biker population watches with a mixture of astonishment and amusement as the completely naked terminator calmly walks in between them inspecting every male costumer on the way it stops in front of a cigarsmoking biker as it finds out that the mans clothes are a match to its body size the terminator calmly tells him that it needs his clothes boots and motorcycle causing much hilarity among the other customers the cigar man tells it that it forgot to say please and blows smoke in terminators face he then puts out his cigar on terminators bare chest only to be surprised that it doesnt seem to feel the pain terminator forcefully grabs the mans hand and twists his arm another biker hits terminator in the head with a pool cue but he gets thrown out of the front window by the unaffected terminator the cigar biker is thrown into the kitchen on the hot stove and when another biker trying to attack gets nailed to the pool table with his own knife the rest of the customers decide to pull off their attack terminator enters the kitchen and quickly grabs away the gun the cigar biker pulled out after which he throws terminator his keys and tells it to take itas george thorogoods bad to the bone plays the terminator steps outside fully dressed and mounts one of the motorcycles as the barkeeper comes out and fires a warning shot with his shotgun threatening to kill him if he doesnt come off the bike the terminator gets off and calmly walks towards the man and with a quick move it relieves the barkeeper of his shotgun and sunglasses without hurting the man it puts on the glasses and leaves on the bikein a different part of town a police officer calls in a strange electrical disturbance to headquarters as he inspects the area and notices a strange round hole burned into a fence he is approached from behind by another naked man robert patrick more slender and less bulky than terminator this is the t1000 who instantly kills the officer with a quick jab in the gut the t1000 picks up the cops gun enters the police car fully clothed and uses the cars computer to find the address of john connorat john connors house his foster parents todd xander berkeley and janelle voight jenette goldstein make several fruitless attempts to get john to clean up his room but he ignores and ridicules them and leaves on his bike with his friend tim danny cookseyat pescadero state hospital a detention center for the criminally insane sarah connor has been incarcerated here and is performing some exercises in her cell psychiatrist dr silberman earl boen is showing some interns around telling them about sarahs acute schizoaffective disorder which leads her to believe that a machine in human guise called the terminator was sent back through time to kill her and that the father of her child was a soldier from the future sent back to protect her silberman greets her good morning to which sarah pseudopolitely asks about his knee which she stabbed with a pen some weeks before silberman has the interns take a look at her like she is a caged animal and then asks two orderlies to make sure that sarah tidies her room and takes her medicine the orderlies enter the cell but sarah refuses the medication they tell her to be good because she is on review that afternoon but when she keeps refusing they smack her in the gut with a baton kick her around and zap her with a tazer before they force the medication down her throat and leave hermeanwhile the t1000 arrives at the house of john connor and it asks his foster parents about john when they indicate that john has gone it asks for johns picture saying it only needs to ask john some questions todd mentions a big guy on a bike the terminator asking about john that morning as well but despite its suspicious glance the t1000 assures them not to worryat that moment john is raiding an atm with a special machine tim finds a picture of sarah in johns bag it is the picture the one that was taken of sarah at the end of the previous movie and was later given to johns father kyle reese to which john comments that sarah is a complete psycho because she got arrested for trying to blow up a computer factory they take off for the mall to spend the stolen cash missing the searching terminator by a few blockssarah is in deep sleep from the medication when she is woken by a familiar voice it is kyle reese michael biehn the man who died protecting her from the first terminator he tells her that john is in danger and that she needs to protect him to which she replies that he doesnt believe her anymore reese talks some strength back into her and repeats his earlier message the future is not set there is no fate but what we make for ourselves she hugs him but when she opens her eyes reese is standing in the cell door opening saying that there is not much time left in the world he walks away and sarah follows him out of the hospital she finds herself on a sunny grass field behind a fence on the other side are children playing in a playground she tries to warn them away but no sound comes from her mouth then there is a sudden bright flash and she wakes up next to her bed in her cellduring the psychological review later that day sarah watches a video from one of her earlier evaluations where she described her dream of the world and its children burning in a nuclear nightmare she went into a fit of rage because no one seemed to believe her prediction silberman stops the video and sarah tells him that she is feeling much better now she no longer believes in the existence of terminators and recants her claim that the factory where she crushed one covered the whole thing upmeanwhile in a computer lab elsewhere a computer developer called miles dyson joe morton is asked permission to conduct a test with a certain device that is only referred to as it when one of his coworkers asks where it came from he gives him the same answer he received from his superiors dont ask dyson goes into the vault where he observes a fragment of a computer chip and a metal robot arm that was clearly once attached to a terminatorsarah asks silberman to transfer her to a minimum security ward but he believes that she is merely faking her recovery and thinks she will only use this transfer for another escape attempt when he also refuses to let her see her son she attacks him before she is restrained and drugged by orderliesjohn is driving with tim through an abandoned canal while the terminator passes overhead identifies him and lays in a pursuit meanwhile the t1000 shows johns picture to a couple of girls who direct it to the galleria terminator arrives at the galleria and identifies johns bike while john is inside playing arcade games both the t1000 and the terminator carrying his shotgun in a longbox full of roses are searching for him the t1000 is directed to the game hall where he bumps into tim who is getting some more quarters it shows tim johns picture tim pretends he doesnt know the person but quickly walks back to john and warns him that a cop is looking for him john runs away being chased by the t1000 and ends up trapped in a hallway between the terminator who produces his shotgun and the t1000 coming in from behind john terminator however shoots the t1000 with his shotgun but the t1000 quickly recovers and fires an entire clip at john killing an innocent bystander the terminator puts itself in front of john acting as a shield he puts john into safety and returns fire at the t1000 who staggers backward and falls to the ground motionlessbut as the terminator reloads his gun the large metallic holes the shots made in the t1000s chest suddenly fill up it gets up and there is a short struggle between him and the terminator for the gun in the fight they force each other into the wall several times until one wall finally gives and they tumble into a clothing store the t1000 is quicker on its feet throws the terminator out through the shopwindow and gets back to chasing john shoppers are amazed to see the terminator get back on its feet so quickly one of them manages to take some pictures grabbing its gun and following after john tooin the meantime john has reached his motorcycle but has problems getting it to start as the t1000 enters the garage and dashes towards him john gets the bike to work and drives away barely shaking off his assailant as he makes it to the street the t1000 hitches an involuntary ride from a passing truck by throwing its driver out and pursues john with little regard for other roadusers it in turn is being chased by the terminator on its motorcyclejohn makes it to the old drainage canal apparently in safety but the truck suddenly comes up from a bridge and takes an immense dive into the canal john drives off and although the canal is a hard place for maneuvering a truck it and its driver keep gaining on john in the meanwhile the terminator is driving along the edge of the canal firing some shots at the truck which is nearing a bridge spanning the canal the bridge rips off the truck cabins roof but the cop has ducked away and maintains control of the vehicle he tries to overrun john as the terminator reaches a dead end in the elevation and is forced to jump down with its bike into the canal it manages to pass the truck and drive alongside john picks him up from his bike puts him in front of itself and puts a bullet in the trucks tire the truck crashes into another column in the canal and blows up the terminator stops the bike points its gun at the blazing fire but only a burning tire rolls out he drives away with john but seconds later the t1000 emerges as a shiny featureless metallic man its features start to become more pronounced and its colours return to normal forming into the unharmed pseudocop againas they ride off john asks the terminator to pull over his rescuer confirms it is a terminator it is from cyberdyne systems model 101 a cybernetic organism living tissue over a metal endoskeleton john checks the bullet holes in the terminators back but still has a hard time buying it he already realizes that the terminator has not come to kill him terminator explains that it was reprogrammed and sent 35 years in the future by john himself to be his protector in the current timeat the canal the fire department has started to extinguish the fire from the crashed truck the fake cop is observing silently as he steals a police car unnoticedits evening and while driving the bike terminator explains that the other guy is a t1000 an advanced prototype made of mimetic polyalloy or liquid metal it says they have to get out of the city and avoid the authorities john wants to stop by his house but terminator assures him the t1000 would definitely try to reacquire him there as it itself would trythey stop by a pay phone because john insists on calling his foster parents to warn them janelle answers and expresses her concern for john john is confused as she is never this nice he can hear todd through the phone yelling at the dog for barking continuously but he is suddenly silenced john worries that the t1000 might be there already the terminator asks john for the dogs name its max it takes over the horn and asks janelle with johns voice what is wrong with wolfy janelle says wolfy is fine the terminator hangs up and tells john his foster parents are dead on cue the camera pulls back to reveal that janelle is actually the t1000 mimicking her its arm has formed into a silver blade which has skewered todds head and the milk carton he was carrying it retracts the blade letting todds lifeless body fall to the ground and it slowly reforms into its arm the t1000 then reshapes into its cop formterminator explains to john that the t1000 can imitate everything of equal size that it has sampled previously by physical contact it cant become a bomb or other complex machines with chemicals and moving parts but it can form knives and stabbing weaponsthe t1000 walks outside into the backyard of the voights house toward max the dog who is barking loudly it kills the dog with a quick jab and rips off its collar it reads max it knows it has been fooledat pescadero hospital a police detective shows sarah connor some pictures from the west highland police station taken by a video surveillance camera in 1984 they show the first terminator on a killing spree inside the station the detective explains that the unknown man killed 17 police officers with families and children that night his colleague shows her pictures taken by the tourist they show the exact same man the officers tell her john is missing and that his foster parents were murdered and ask her about the guy in the picture but she doesnt give the slightest response dr silberman tells them she is fading out of reality and lets them out sarah secretly takes a paperclip from the desk before one of the wardens takes her back to her celljohn tells the terminator about his time in nicaragua where sarah hooked up with several guys to gather weapons and teach john to become a great military leader john now realizes that she was right all the time and he wants to rescue her terminator refuses stating that t1000 will most likely copy sarah and wait for john to come over when john hears that the subject being copied is typically terminated he insists on going immediately terminator restrains him stating sarah is not a mission priority john objects and calls out for help but when he orders it to let go the android complies to his joy john finds out that obeying him is one of the terminators mission parameters john tests it by ordering it to stand on one foot it complies two guys are responding to johns cry for help they get into an argument and john has terminator grab one of the guys by his hair when the other guy attacks terminator breaks his hand and tries to shoot him john prevents this from happening and sends the guys away he tries to explain to terminator why he cant just kill people but the robot doesnt understand john tries to convince it that it is something he just cant do orders it to help him save his mother and they ride onin the meantime the t1000 arrives at pescadero and is given access by one of the guards sarah is restrained to her bed by douglas the warden ken gibbel he humilliates her further locks her cell and bangs his baton against several cell doors as he leaves sarah spits out the paperclip she stole and uses it to pick the locks of her restraints and the door lock the t1000 comes up at a desk and asks the nurse for sarah connor she tells him that other cops have already been with her for an hour as she sees them coming out when she looks back at the t1000 she notices that he has gone he is nowhere in the hallway she lets lewis don stanton one of the guards through the security door he shows the police officers out before he walks over to a coffee machine but as he steps on the chequered hallway floor immediately a face appears out of it it is the t1000 mimicking the floor rising up and slowly copying the shape and image of lewis who is unaware of his counterpart forming behind him when he turns around he is astounded to be facing himself the t1000 for this scene is played by don stantons identical twin brother dan stanton the t1000 pierces lewiss head by extruding his finger into a long ice picklike extension then drags his body into a cleaning room he makes his way to the maximum security wingmeanwhile douglas finds that one of the maintenance rooms has been opened and that a broom handle has been broken off as he exits the room he is punched to pulp by sarah with the broom handle dragged and locked into her room she takes his keys and baton and leaves she hides from lewis actually the t1000 who is walking in one of the adjacent wings t1000 changes back into the cop form as sarah sneaks up to silberman and a warden she beats the warden unconscious and breaks silbermans arm she drugs the warden with a tranquillizer and fills the empty syringe with sink cleaning fluidjohn and the terminator arrive at pescadero and john makes it swear that it will not kill anyone when the guard wont let them through the gate terminator shoots him in the legs reassuring john that the man will survive they park the motorcycle in the garage sarah arrives with silberman as her hostage at the security office she has the poisonfilled syringe in his neck and she reassures silberman that she has no problems killing him since she already believes him dead anyway he makes the guards open the door she gets through but doesnt notice another guard behind her he saves silberman from her hands but gets punched to the floor sarah makes a run for it the guards sound the alarm which also attracts the attention of the t1000 which just discovered the drugged guard sarah manages to lock out the chasing wardens by breaking off a key so they have to find an alternate routesarah makes it to the elevators but to her horror an old acquaintance walks out the terminator her tormentor from the past with a yell of fear and disbelief she runs back the other way sarah is so blinded by panic that she hardly notices johns calls the wardens who have found another access route work her to the floor and try to subdue herjohn asks terminator to help his mother it walks over to the wardens who have a hard time restraining sarah who is frantically yelling hell kill us all dr silberman tries to give sarah a tranquillizer shot but terminator grabs the wardens around him one by one except for silberman and smashes them against the windows and walls knocking them out but not killing them john crouches down by sarah who is looking at him and terminator in utter disbelief john assures her that the terminator is here to help and she grabs its hand but at that time t1000 appears at the end of the hallway blocked by a set of bars it walks through them with ease its liquid metal pouring through the bars like pudding john and sarah run to the elevator as terminator fires several shots at t1000 which slow it down t1000 runs past a stunned silberman firing but terminator serves as shield again before the elevator doors close behind him t1000 however uses his knifearms to pry the door open but terminator quickly fires a shot at its head at point blank splitting the head apart the elevator goes down as t1000 melts its head back together it pries the doors open again and jumps on the roof of the elevator stabbing his knives through the roof hoping to hit one of its targets terminator and sarah fire several shots back at the roof before sarahs shoulder is cut by one of t1000s lucky stabs the elevator arrives at the garage and they all exit sarah commandeers a police car that is just arriving the t1000 has perforated the roof enough to pour itself through a small hole as an amorphous blob of metal it quickly reshapes into human form opens the elevator door and starts to chase so terminator is forced to drive away in reverse they fire several clips and shells at it but it keeps gaining after exiting the garage terminator manages to spin the car 180 degrees but this momentary slowdown allows t1000 to make a jump at the car and haul itself onto it with its armhooks it smashes the back window and slices at john but terminator manages to shoot it off the driving car it gets back on its feet but stops its pursuit as it realizes it cannot keep up with the car on foot john notices a severed hook still sticking in the cars trunk and throws it on the street t1000 walks towards it merges the hook back into its foot and walks back to pescaderojohn sarah and terminator drive away at high speed safe from the deadly t1000 at least for now sarah opens her arms to john apparently to give him a big hug but she only wants to check him for wounds or bruises john assures her that he is okay but sarah reprimands him for risking his life trying to save her he is too important for that john is baffled by sarahs cold reaction saying that he just needed to get her out of there but she bluntly responds that she can take care of herself terminator asks john about the tears in his eyes but he says its nothingt1000 returns on foot at pescadero where the police have arrived a cop on a motorcycle asks if he is okay it affirms and compliments the cop with his nice motorcyclethe three fugitives arrive at an abandoned gas station and hide the car in the garage terminator tends to sarahs shoulder wound stating that it knows what it is doing because it has detailed files on human anatomy sarah remarks that this makes him a more efficient killer terminator confirms the notion sarah in turn removes the bullets from terminators back john asks is it feels any pain to which terminator replies that it senses injuries which could be regarded as pain it explains that its wounds will heal up which is good according to sarah because he wont be of much use if he cant pass for a human terminator explains to john that it will last 120 years with its existing power cell that its cpu central processing unit is a learning computer and that it can learn more about being human as it has more contact with humansalternative scene terminator explains to john that its cpu is a learning computer but skynet disables the learning ability when terminators are sent out alone when john suggests that they can reset the switch he and sarah start operating on the terminator she removes part of its scalp opens its metal skull and removes the chip inside shutting down the android completely however to johns horror she wants to destroy the chip because she doesnt trust johns new friend she wants to use this opportunity to disable it but john convinces her that they need it and that if he is to be a great military leader she should start listening to some of his ideas for a change reluctantly she concedes and they reinsert the chipthe terminator keeps watch all night and at dawn he hotwires another vehicle john teaches him that some cars have the keys tucked behind the sun visor to get away from the city as fast as possible they drive through the desert to one of sarahs hideout places john notices that the terminator always uses words like affirmative he teaches him to use more colloquial terms such as no problemo eat me hasta la vista baby and chill out dickwad they stop at a gas station for some food  john sees how serious his mother is all the time and he tells the terminator that it could smile once in a while too to give an example john unsuccessfully attempts to make one of the restaurant attendants smile then points at a guy at a phone booth smiling the terminator tries to imitate him but the result is less than convincing so john advises it to practice in front of a mirror firstjohn sees some children playing with toy guns he ponders that humans as a species probably wont make it terminator comments that it is in their nature to destroy themselves sarah inquires about who is responsible for building skynet as they start driving again terminator tells her that it is miles bennett dyson a high ranking employee at cyberdyne systems who will invent a new microprocessor that will revolutionize the entire military computer system cyberdyne computers will completely replace human functions and decisions in strategic defense systems as the skynet program goes online on august 4th 1997 it learns at such a fast rate that it becomes selfaware on august 29th as the humans try to shut it down skynet starts a nuclear strike that plunges earths nations into a nuclear war in which the humans destroy each other sarah asks for detailed files about dysonat the dyson residence miles is frantically working on his computer though he promised his wife tarissa s epatha merkerson to take the children out swimming miles tries to explain to her that his work on the new microprocessor is very important and that he is very close to completing it tarissa jokingly wonders why they started a family anyway since he seems more concerned with his project miles surrenders and takes the kids out to playsarah john and terminator arrive at a outlying farm in the desert that seems abandoned however her friend enrique salceda castulo guerra being very suspicious of unannounced visitors comes out of hiding at the sound of her voice he welcomes sarah john and terminator who john introduces as uncle bob and tells them that they are all over the news as wanted persons enrique is not too thrilled to hear that sarah has come to collect most of his stuff clothes food and a truck she orders john and terminator to gather weapons terminator opens a secret stash filled with lots of weapons and ammunition sarah notifies enrique about her plans to cross the border after nightfall and tells him to leave the range as well since it is dangerous for him too he already expected that sarah would bring trouble but he seems to be used to it while working in the weapons stash john tells how he grew up learning about weapons and explosives and how he had a hard time adjusting to a normal life after sarah got arrested he learns from the terminator that it has no fear of death nor feels any other emotion about it it just has to stay functional until its mission is complete john thinks about himself the same way although he is not too keen about the important role he has yet to playterminator uncovers a minigun which makes even the android smilewhile helping terminator repair a truck john wonders about his real father who he will meet when he is in his forties but who hasnt even been born yet john thinks sarah still cries about him sometimes terminator asks him why people cry john tells him it happens when people are hurt although not physically the machine doesnt understand when the truck works again john teaches terminator how to do a high five as sarah watches them from a distance she narrates watching john with the machine it was suddenly so clear the terminator would never stop never leave him never hurt him never shout at him or get drunk and hit him or say it was too busy to spend time with him it would always be there and it would die to protect him of all the wouldbe fathers who came and went over the years this machine was the only one who measured up in an insane world it was the sanest choicesarah carves at a wooden table with her knife and watches enrique playing happily with his family she falls asleep and finds herself in a green pasture behind a fence on the other side children are playing in a playground she tries to warn them away but no sound comes from her mouth she sees a younger innocent version of herself among the people dressed in her old waitress uniform playing with infant john also seemingly aware that something is wrong as sarah vainly pounds the fence in frustration a blinding white flash illuminates the area with screams of terror everybody faces away from the white light as the bright light dies down it reveals a huge nuclear cloud column at the horizon in an instant the ambient temperature is raised to extremes causing sarah everyone and everything to spontaneously burst into flames a panoramic shot shows a nuclear shock wave propagating through downtown la turning every building in its path into instant rubble cars buses buildings and trees are singed and blown to pieces and as the fire reaches the burnt people their ashes spread like black dust in the wind as the fire burns sarahs flesh away leaving only her skeleton hanging by the fence she wakes up with a shock realizing it was a dream she looks at the words she just carved into the table no fate she knows that she can only stop her dream from becoming reality if she acts nowsarah sticks the knife into the table gathers an m16 rifle and her gear and gets into the car john sees it and hears from enrique that he and terminator are supposed to proceed towards the south where sarah will meet up with them tomorrow john runs towards sarah trying to talk to her but she drives off quickly without a word or looking back john reads the words on the table no fate john explains to terminator that it was a message from his future self to sarah passed on by his father kyle the future is not set there is no fate but what we make for ourselves when terminator guesses that sarah intends to change the future john suddenly realizes that she is going after miles dyson they quickly take off in the repaired truckas sarah races ahead terminator warns john that t1000 has the same data files and might be waiting for them at dysons house but john is intent on stopping sarah terminator suggests that dysons murder might actually prevent the war from happening but john does not want to hear about it he angrily blames terminator for still not understanding the value of human life the android still has difficulty caring about anything but john insists that it try to learnat the dyson residence sarah sets up her silenced gun behind the swimming pool where she can see miles working on his computer unaware of the danger outside dysons son danny devaughn nixon is playing in the house with his remote controlled car waving off his mothers orders to go to bed like his sister outside sarah loads the rifle and takes aim pointing a red laser at the back of miless head at the moment of firing danny drives the remote car against miles foot making him quickly bend over to pick it up the bullet misses him and hits the computer screen as miles realizes the shot came through the window sarah fires again but misses miles takes cover behind his desk so sarah takes the house under rapid fire miles warns away his wife and son as sarah reloads and empties another clip into the room she takes a handgun and walks to the house miles sees her and makes a run for his living room sarah fires several shots at him and the third one hits miles in the shoulder he collapses to the floor as his wife and son get to him sarah tries to force them away at gunpoint but the young boy stays pleading for his fathers life miles pushes the boy away to his mother asking sarah to let the boy go but her eyes are wild with rage she raves at the bewildered man that everything is his fault and that she will not let him do it miles starts to cry uncontrollably and sarah realizes what she is about to do she does not pull the trigger she backs away and sinks to the floor cryingjohn and terminator enter the ravaged house fearing that they are too late john takes care of his mother and tells terminator to check the dysons sarah is almost traumatized realizing that she nearly killed a man and john hugs her assuring her that they will find a way finally she is able to tell him she loves him and he returns her affection terminator diagnoses miless injury as a flesh wound and instructs miles wife to stop the bleeding by putting pressure on the wound miles asks john and terminator who they are john gives terminator a knife tells it to show miles what it is and takes danny away to his room with gasps and cries of horror and disbelief miles and his wife watch the terminator make large cuts in its arm and remove the skin to reveal a sophisticatedly crafted bloody metal arm and hand the same kind miles saw on display at cyberdyne terminator requests that miles and tarissa listen carefullysarah narrates dyson listened while the terminator laid it all down skynet judgment day the history of things to come its not every day that you find out you are responsible for 3 billion deaths he took it pretty well miles is taken aback by the story but tries to defend himself against accusations for things he has not even done yet by asking how he was supposed to know sarah sneers that this is the excuse of all men thinking they are great and creative while inventing nothing but death and destruction john cuts off her reproaches because those sort of discussions dont get them anywhere miles tells them he will stop working on the processor and quit his job at cyberdyne but sarah and terminator convince him that nobody must be allowed to finish his work the lab and all relevant files in his home must be destroyed also miles ask if they know about the chip at cyberdyne which came from the first terminator although he was not informed about its origin at the time this confirms all of sarahs suspicions about the factory covering up the whole incident with her and the first terminator the chip was broken but it gave miles the inspiration for his revolutionary new chip design miles offers to help them pass cyberdynes security to completely destroy itthe camera moves fast over a road at night as sarah narrates the future always so clear to me had become like a black highway at night we were in uncharted territory now making up history as we went along the shot pans up to reveal the cyberdyne buildingthe group arrives at the cyberdyne lab headquarters packed with large bags full of equipment miles gets them through the main entrance to the security desk and tries to convince the guard that they are friends who he wants to show around as the guard berates him for bringing visitors without special authorization they draw their weapons and terminator tells him that it insists they restrain the guard and use an elevator to move to the second floor where miles explains how they need his key and another one in the security station to open the vault holding the chip and terminator armmeanwhile another guard returns to the front desk and grumbles at his partner for leaving the desk unattended only to find the man tied up and gagged inside the toilet miles and sarah enter the security station as the guard triggers the silent alarm miless access card no longer opens the key locker the alarm has neutralized all codes inside the building he wants to abort but sarah convinces him they have to go all the way john assures them that his special machine for illegally withdrawing money from atms will do the trick meanwhile the two guards downstairs have identified sarah and terminator as the two wanted criminals from the news they call for all police units in the area miless entry code wont open the door to the lab so terminator suggests using his which means blowing through the door with a grenade launcher this sets off the gaseous fire extinguishing system preventing sarah and miles from entering the lab however terminator can walk through the gasses unharmed and retrieves two breathing masks for them they enter the lab and get to workt1000 arrives at the dyson residence wearing a motor cop suit helmet and shiny glasses he finds the house deserted all computers destroyed and several stacks of paper burning he hears a dispatch on his police radio calling in the situation at cyberdyne systems and the suspects sarah connor escaped from pescadero state hospital the night before and a white male possible killer from the west highland police station massacre in 1984terminator is chopping up several computers and servers with a fire axe miles directs sarah to all the disks and processors containing important data that must be destroyed sarah tells him they will blow it all up then miles sees the enlarged model of his new chip design he asks terminator for his axe says he worked a lot of years on the model then smashes it apart with a violent strike of the axea large police force arrives at the cyberdyne building the police radio calls the suspects armed and extremely dangerous the police lay siege to the building while a police helicopter circles around shining its spotlight inside a deserted office area john has finally opened the key locker and retrieves the vault key as he leaves he narrowly avoids being spotted by the helicopter a quick glimpse on a monitor shows him the entire police force barricaded outside sarah and terminator are placing barrels of explosive liquids and detonation packs terminator gives miles a remote control showing him how they are going to set off the explosions john enters the lab with the key telling the others they have company  about the entire police force sarah says she will finish up and orders them to go ahead terminator says it will take care of the police john reminds him of his promises but terminator reassures him with a simple trust me the android goes to the front of the building and breaks a window with one of the desks it ignores the polices order to surrender and starts firing rapid shots from the minigun down to the police cars on the ground the helicopter quickly moves off terminator finishes off the remaining cars with the grenade launcher giving the panicked cops time to flee its internal processing screen indicates there are no human casualties terminator retreats as the police open heavy fire on the building john and miles reach the vault and open it john simply breaks the glass cases around the chip fragment and metal arm indicating that they got skynet by the ballsa heavily armed swat team enters the building and proceeds to the second floor as sarah and the rest prepare to leave she gives john the gas masks and he and terminator leave the room as sarah asks miles for the detonator the swat team bursts into the lab opening fire sarah takes cover behind a desk but miles is hit several times and sinks to the floor john tries to get to his mom but terminator prevents him from endangering himself sarah looks at the mortally injured miles who holds the detonator in his hand with a silent expression he assures her that he will take care of it sarah waits for the swat members to reload fires several shots from her sidearm into the air and then makes a run for the back of the lab glass windows around her break as the swat team opens fire on her and she barely rolls herself to cover in the room where the vault is john is following her escape on a monitor and tells terminator there is no other exit for her there with a loud thud it breaks through the wall and pulls sarah in through the hole it breaks a steel door with another blast of its grenade launcher and the three make their way through a safe corridor to the elevatorthe swat team advances through the lab towards miles who is holding a piece of his chip model above a detonator switch with heavy dying breaths he tells the swat leader that he doesnt know how much longer he can hold it up realizing the imminent danger the swat leader dean norris orders his team to pull back immediately as john sarah and terminator get into the elevator miles rate of breathing becomes slower and slower finally it stops and he drops the part onto the trigger an enormous explosion erupts from the building destroying the entire labthe elevator comes to an abrupt halt on the first floor t1000 arrives on its motorcycle between the burntout car wrecks in front of the cyberdyne building the elevator doors open and terminator checks the lobby which is full of the swat team members they fire tear gas grenades to the elevator which forces john and sarah to buddybreathe with the only remaining gas mask terminator tells them to stay there it will be back it advances towards the swat team ignoring their leaders orders to lie down on the floor they open fire the bullets ripping pieces of flesh from its metal body but they cannot stop his advance as it closes in on them it uses its sidearm to shoot the men in the legs it uses the gas grenade launcher to disable the remaining two members t1000 drives its motorcycle up one of the staircases of the blownout building terminator exits through the main entrance and fires the remaining gas grenades at the police disabling the entire force it relieves two remaining swat members of their van correctly remembering that the keys are tucked behind the sun visor drives it through the main entrance and picks up john and sarah it takes off at high speed as several police officers fire shots at the van as t1000 drives through the destroyed lab it hears the gunshots and sees the swat van leaving in the distance when it notices the helicopter flying near the building it accelerates jumps its motorcycle out of the building and grabs hold of the helicopter as the bike crashes to the ground the dumbstruck pilot watches t1000 climb on the canopy break it with its head liquefy into its amorphous chrome form pour into the helicopter next to the pilot and instantly reform into its previous appearance telling him to get out the flabbergasted pilot complies and jumps out t1000 pursues the vanin the back of the van sarah buries john under a pile of bulletproof vests telling him to stay under them no matter what happens she also covers the vans back windows with vests as she notices the helicopter closing in terminator tells her it is t1000 sarah and t1000 exchange automatic weapon fire as terminator navigates the highway narrowly missing several cars it drives under a bridge but the helicopter simply follows they pass a large truck which forces t1000 to fly over another bridge it quickly gains on the truck and manages to hit sarah in the leg terminator abruptly stops the van causing the helicopter to crash into the back of the van it crumbles and crashes violently onto the road the crash causes one of the vans tires to rip and the van topples over on the road the driver of the large truck has come to a halt at the crashed helicopter as a driver from a pickup truck comes to check on the tippedover van the largetruck driver is amazed to see t1000 appearing unharmed from the wrecked helicopter but t1000 simply skewers him with his bladehand and mounts the truck terminator john and sarah stumble from the swat van the pickup truck driver backs away from terminators large facial wounds as it sees the large truck emerging from the smoke several hundred yards back it reads liquid nitrogen on the side the three commandeer the pickup truck as t1000s truck rams a stopped car out of the way in the distance terminator quickly drives away as t1000 smashes the remains of the swat van the pickup driver can barely get out of the wayjohn uses a tshirt from the truck to slow the bleeding from sarahs leg terminator tries to stay ahead but 60 mph is the pickup trucks top speed as sarah binds her leg and howls out in pain the large truck rams into the back of the pickup t1000 tries to crush the pickup against the siderail but another truck coming up ahead forces it to move away terminator tells john to take over the wheel and fires a grenade at the large truck which takes it slightly off course terminator tells john to take the off ramp but t1000 follows john narrowly misses another truck as terminator fires another grenade it hits the truck on the side the truck rams into the pickup from behind again causing terminator to drop a grenade shell john drives the truck through the gates of a steel mill closely followed by t1000 terminator grabs its m16 rifle climbs over onto the hood of t1000s truck empties the entire clip into the liquid android then turns the wheel quickly to the left causing the large truck to topple over on its side and slide behind john and sarah terminator holds on to the still moving tippedover truck as john drives through a steel foundry hangar full of workers the pickup truck comes to an abrupt halt when it impales itself onto a parked lifttruck on of its lifters passing between john and his mother as the sliding truck comes screeching into the hangar and crashes against one side of the entrance terminator jumps off rolls himself to safety and comes to a stop against a couple of pipes the enormous momentum causes the truck to split open in the middle and liquid nitrogen starts pouring out of the rupture as the evaporating nitrogen invades the work area one of the workers sounds the alarm and all workers instantly evacuate john sarah and terminator watch the t1000 clambering out of the truck cabin under a pouring rain of liquid nitrogen as the android appears from the cloud of vapour it seems to be moving much more sluggishly than usual a layer of frost covers the creaking t1000 as it attempts to walk but its frozen feet keep sticking to the floor its continuous efforts to walk cause the legs to break off at the ankle and knees trying to break its fall with its hand t1000 finds the hand frozen to the floor as well with a violent pull it breaks free snapping off its arm to its own astonishment a few creaking tweaks and turns follow and it remains motionless terminator picks itself up from the floor points its gun and shoots the frozen android into hundreds of small pieces saying hasta la vista babyjohn gets out of the truck to watch his broken enemy however one of the pools of molten metal in the hangar has begun to overflow and the heat starts to thaw up the frozen pieces the metal becomes liquid again and the drops start to coalesce into one big blob terminator says there is not much time anymore and john helps sarah getting up as the liquid metal blob is already shaping into the familiar human form again terminator reloads its grenade launcher with the shell it dropped earlier and helps john moving sarah when t1000 is again fully formed and in his normal cop form again it follows john sarah and terminator on foot as they start going deeper into the steel millwhile holding on to a yellowblack striped bar the t1000 finds that its arm has unwillingly mimicked the striped pattern of the bar it pulls the hand loose from the bar changes it back to normal with a simple flick and starts following its targets again terminator leads john and sarah through the maze of equipment and machinery in the steel mill as the t1000 closes in there is a glitch going over its surface apparently it has difficulty keeping its current form its feet keep taking on the colour and texture of the metal profiled floorjohn sarah and terminator come up at the edge of a molten metal pool but sarah cant stand the heat they return but see the t1000 approaching a few yards ahead terminator sends john and sarah on their way john wants to stick together but terminator firmly tells him to flee sarah drags john away while terminator gets its gun and grenade launcher at the ready its internal processing screen searches for the t1000 which suddenly emerges from the side and kicks away the launcher there is a nasty and violent fight between the two terminators in which they pound each other against the metal surfaces around them t1000 is thrown head first against a steel wall but it quickly morphs itself backwards ready to fight again terminator punches into its head but its opponent simply liquefies reforms around terminators fist launches it against some more walls and finally forces its arm between two large cogwheels out of reach t1000 takes on its human texture again and leaves terminator stuck in the machinerysarah and john take a few steps towards a platform terminator picks up an iron bar and uses it to amputate its arm to free itself john and sarah see the t1000 already coming up to the platform sarah lowers john along a chain onto a conveyor belt below but stays behind herself despite johns desperate calls to come along sarah reloads her shotgun and fires it at t1000s head it leaves a large hole around its right eye which fills up quickly it finds out that john has escaped before sarah can reload and fire another shot t1000 extends one of its fingers and skewers her left shoulder to the wall it orders sarah to call john but she refuses it tortures sarah by moving its fingerblade inside her wounded shoulder threatens to pierce her head with its other finger and repeats the order but she still doesnt comply at that moment terminator takes a slice at t1000 with the iron bar almost chopping off its arm and side but t1000 kicks terminator back mends its body and simply pulls the bar out it pounds terminator with the bar throwing terminator in front of a large suspended beam t1000 uses the beam to crush terminator against the wall several times causing the right eye to come out exposing the red robotic eye and metal skull the heavily crushed terminator attempts to pull itself away with its remaining hand towards a lower platform where its grenade launcher still rests but before it can grasp the launcher t1000 forces the metal bar into terminators chest prying in its insides it retracts the bar again but before terminator can make another attempt at the launcher t1000 forces the bar all the way through it and the grated floor electrical discharges erupt from the metal body as the red dot in the terminators eye slowly dies and its body goes limpsarah grabs her shotgun and reloads with the little remaining strength she has john crawls out of the conveyor belt tunnel and hides behind some equipment terminators mechanical eye seems to come back to life its internal processing screen shows that an alternate power route inside the metal body has been found and the eye becomes fully red it pulls the iron bar from its body and the floor and grabs the grenade launcherin his hiding place john hears his mother calling him he walks several steps and platforms over to her to find her limping along a wall she asks for his help but then sarah appears behind her armed with a shotgun she tells john to get out of the way john looks down to see that sarahs feet have seemingly been fused to the grated floor and realizes it is the t1000 played by linda hamiltons identical twin leslie hamilton gearren john yells shoot and a large metal hole appears in the t1000assarahs body in an instant the wound closes and the t1000 morphs back into its familiar cop face sarah fires a volley of shots at t1000 which bring him staggering towards the edge of the platform above one of the molten metal pools but as he is one step away from falling in sarahs shotgun is empty t1000 heals his wounds and sarah fires again but the gun only clicks t1000 makes a childish naughtygesture with its finger then starts advancing on john and sarah they turn around to see terminator emerging on top of a conveyor belt armed with the grenade launcher they get down and terminator fires his grenade into t1000s gut it gives a look of astonishment before the grenade violently explodes inside its body is completely burst open the head and arms hanging from mere threads as it loses its balance and falls screeching into the pool of molten metal the effect is devastating as john and sarah watch the t1000 splashes and thrashes in the pool screaming in agony uncontrollably morphing through the forms it previously adapted the first policeman janelle voight lewis the guard the motorcycle cop desperately screaming and fighting against a destructive force several more heads and arms pop out of its body it takes the rough shape of a giant openmouthed head that turns insideout before it finally returns into a terrified face that dissolves in the metaljohn helps up the terminator which looks like a wrecked car and says it needs a vacation they look at the molten pool and john asks if it is dead terminator replies that it is terminated john throws the metal arm and the chip in the steel sarah sighs that it is over but terminator reminds her that there is still one more chip which must be destroyed it points at its skull it hands sarah a remote control for one of the electrically operated pulleys saying that it cannot selfterminate and needs to be lowered in the molten steel sarah looks confused but john cant accept this and desperately pleads to the terminator to stay with them when it apologizes and tells him that it has to do it john tearfully orders it not to go terminator remains silent for a while looking john in the eyes and tells him it knows now why he cries but it is something it can never do john hugs the android which shakes sarahs outstretched hand then grasps one of the chains sarah activates the pulley lowering the terminator into the pool its clothes burn as it slowly melts away from below in the hot steel it looks up to john who is in tears after the hot metal immerses the face its hand does a final thumbsup before it sinks in the molten metal there is a last look into its internal processing screen which goes static and finally blacks out like a tv screen sarah drops the remote and holds the sobbing john to her shoulder the camera flies over the highway at night again as sarah speaks the unknown future rolls towards us i face it for the first time with a sense of hope because if a machine a terminator can learn the value of human life maybe we can toofade out credits roll to the terminator theme music and you could be mine by guns n roses
