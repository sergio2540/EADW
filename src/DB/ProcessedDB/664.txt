and more detailed and she begins to grasp who it is on the other side of the glass telling the true story of their relationship travis describes how this couples love turned from joyful to stifling explaining how the drunken man was suffocating the young girl with his jealousy and control that he tried to impose on her he tells how the man went so far as to tie a cowbell to the young girls foot so that he would hear if she was trying to leave in the middle of the night and how one time the man caught the young girl and tied her to the stove with his belt jane is coming to tears while travis continues to speak informing the viewer of how he came to loathe himself and why he had disappeared for so long never wanting to see a trace of anybody when he finally finishes jane expresses how hard it had been for her to move on from travis and that she often wondered what had become of him he finally faces the glass turning a lamp on his face so that jane can get a faint glimpse of him he tells
