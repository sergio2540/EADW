somewhere in russia one carrying a nuclear payload a nuclear explosion follows the crash and the world is on alert however white house nuclear expert dr julia kelly doesnt think it was an accident special operations intelligence officer colonel thomas devoe doesnt think so either together they must unravel a conspiracy that goes from europe to new york to stop a terrorist who has no demands the movie begins in an eastern orthodox church in pale bosnia and herzegovina when an unidentified man later revealed to be a bosnian diplomat to the un is murdered in an alley after receiving a page to meet someone outsidethe scene then immediately shifts to a missile base in chelyabinsk russia where ss18 icbms are being decommissioned ten nuclear warheads are loaded onto a train and sent to a separate site for dismantling however a highranking russian general has other plans along with a rogue tactical unit he kills all the soldiers onboard the train and then transfers nine of the warheads to another train he also sets the timer on the one remaining warhead then switches tracks to send his train out of harms way and the transport train on a collision course with a passenger train a few minutes later the trains collide the thermonuclear warhead goes off moments later yielding a blast about 500 kilotons in intensity this immediately garners the attention of the us governmenteven though the detonation was staged to look like an accident white house nuclear expert dr julia kelly kidman is not convinced ss18 warheads can only be detonated deliberately she believes that terrorists are behind the incident her newly assigned military liaison disagrees with her he is smoothtalking and irreverent us army special forces officer lieutenant colonel thomas devoe clooney and he is convinced that the crash and the detonation were both staged to hide the hijacking of the other warheads on board a call to devoes long time friend and russian counterpart dmitri vertekoff armin muellerstahl adds credence to his hypothesiskelly and devoe try to track down the terrorists through an austrian trucking company which is a front for the russian mafia when the mafia realizes they are in fact us government agents they send out several carloads of thugs to kill them vertekoff is killed but kelly and devoe escape with devoe killing most of the wouldbe assassins in the process devoe later finds out through the tracking system of the truck company that the nukes are in a truck headed to iran the truck carrying the warheads is located using a ruse in which devoe convinces the driver over the phone that there is a smart bomb falling towards him causing him to turn out of traffic on a road so that the truck can be seen in an aerial photo after the only russian troops in the area are killed by the general and his men devoe leads a group of usaf special operations and army rangers illegally over the russian border to seize it during the operation one of their choppers is shot down by russian sam battery when they enter russian airspace but the remaining choppers evade the missiles and are able to stop the truck carrying the warheads a savage fight ensues onboard the vehicle and the rogue russian general is killed and the warheads are seized interrogation of the one surviving member of the group reveals that the trigger bomb nominal yield 12 kilotons from one of the warheads is missing it is learned that the bomb was taken by a bosnian serb and that it may be intended to destroy the un headquarters in new yorkone of the terrorists duan gavri marcel iure is a yugoslav without identity i am a serb a croat and a muslim in reference to all sides in the war torn former yugoslavia he wants to avenge the death of his wife and daughter who were killed by a sniper in sniper alley sarajevo he blames the countries of the west for not protecting them and for greedily supplying weapons to all sides in the war he therefore plans to blow up the united nations building in new york city and supplies a videotaped message warning the governments of the west to cease their involvement in the yugoslavian conflict gavri is finally tracked down wounded and cornered into a catholic church near the un davoe confronts gavri saying its not our war gavri responds it is now and promptly commits suicide knowing that the bomb is set to go off in a matter of minutes and cannot be deactivated with seconds to spare kelly is able to remove a part of the bombs explosive lens shell preventing it from creating a critical mass within the plutonium core the remaining explosives go off but the bomb does not detonate and the explosion is confined to the church devoe and kelly both survive the explosion with minor injuries 5.9train nuclear-explosion russia
