he summoned a man whose reputation is a bit shady and reveals that he knows his secrets but also tells him about his wife and her boyfriend and that they are each the beneficiary of their estates he gets the man to agree to kill his wife and he has laid out what appears to be perfect plan only thing is the man was the one who was killed wendice trying to cover everything up decides then to make it appear that margo had an ulterior motive for killing the man and it appears to be working except halliday doesnt believe shes guilty and the police uncover a few anomalies tony wendice ray milland is a former tennis player who married margot grace kelly partly for her money to please his wife he has given up tennis and now sells sports equipment margot once had a relationship with mark halliday robert cummings an american crime scriptwriter but broke it off when he went back to the us for a yearin time they stopped writing to each other and when mark returns to london she tells him that she burned all his letters but one margo explains to mark that the letter was stolen by a blackmailer who demanded £50 so margot payed by mailing the money to a pawn shop location as inteneded but the money was never picked up and the letter was never returned mark tells margo that he wants to tell tony about them so she can divorce tony so she and mark can be together but margot refuses out of fear of hurting tonys feelingsit is also revealed that tony and margot have made their wills naming each other as beneficiary with assets and money totaling £90000 for a year tony meticulously plans margots murder she has no idea that tony knows of her love for mark he has gone to great lengths to steal a handbag containing one of marks letters and even assumed the role of the anonymous brixtonbased blackmailer to find out whether she would pay to have it back she did but he asked for only £50 and she did not of course get the letter back he even watched them having a little farewell party eating spaghetti with mushrooms in marks studio flat in chelseatony slyly withdraws small amounts of money for a year collecting £1000 in used onepound £1 notes with which he plans to pay a contract killer he singles out the perfect man to do the job charles alexander ca swann anthony dawson who now calls himself captain lesgate a former acquaintance who has embarked on a life of petty crime since even before leaving cambridge where he and tony were both students by following him and finding out about his past and associations tony soon gets enough to blackmail swann into murdering his wifetony uses the opportunity of marks return to london to carry out his plan under a pretext he has to prepare an urgent report for his boss he has margot and mark go to the theatre and when they are gone he invites swann to his flat under another pretext  wanting to buy an expensive car from him when swann arrives at 61a charrington gardens that night tony gets down to business there is no time to lose as he has planned the murder for the following night trapped in a corner by the revelations of his past crimes and tempted by the money swann reluctantly agrees to carry out the murdertony has invited mark to join him at a stag party in a nearby hotel this is how he secures himself an alibi the idea is that the police should think that a burglar was surprised by margot that he panicked strangled her and left without the loot he has told swann that he is going to phone his own flat at exactly 1100 pm so that margot will come to the livingroom to answer the phone whereupon she will be murdered by swann there are only two keys to the wendices ground floor apartment before leaving for the stag party tony steals margots key from her handbag and hides it under the stair carpet outside their flat for swann to usemark a writer of crime scenarios says at one point that theoretically he would be able to plan the perfect murder but that it would be impossible to carry out any plan of his because in real life people just do not act according to other peoples plans this is true of margot too instead of listening to the radio in her bedroom when tony and mark are away she tells her husband of her own plans to go to the cinema that night tony has a hard time persuading his wife to instead stay at home and stick into an album some old newspaper clippings of his when he was a tennis star margot finally consents and for that reason takes a seemingly huge pair of scissors out of her mending basket which also contains a pair of her stockings when she has finished the tiresome job she goes to bed carelessly leaving the scissors lying on the desk next to the phoneaccording to tonys plan swann secretly enters the wendices flat shortly before 11 oclock hides behind the drawn curtains a scarf in his hands and waits for the telephone to ring and for margot to come out of her bedroom to answer it at the dinner stag party tonys plans again nearly go wrong when his wristwatch stops and he has to ask for the time and when he learns that it is a few minutes past 1100 he hurriedly leaves the ballroom and to a payphone in the hotel lobby to make the call tony just makes the phone call exactly when swann is considering leaving his flat as expected margot gets up enters the living room area and awnsers the phone when she does the plan goes terribly wrong swann attacks her from behind with tony all the while listening in to what is going on over the phone but margot turns out to be rather strong and eventually stabs swann in the back with the scissors that are left on the desk he falls backwards to the floor right onto the scissors and is dead at once in his panic tony tells his sobbing wife not to touch or do anything until he has come home which he hurriedly doesclearly nervous tony has to work fast now if he wants to come up with an new plan to kill margot he soon realizes he can make it look as if margot had been blackmailed by swann that he came to her flat in person and that she actually let him in with the intention of murdering him rather than killing him in selfdefense after calling the police and sending margot back to bed he plants marks letter on swann to make it appear that he was the one who sent blackmail letters to margot finds the latch key on swann and puts it back in margots handbag and burns the scarf that swann used replacing it with one of margots stockings he hides the twin stocking on the desk but intentionally accidentally uncovers it for the police to find making it look as though margot inflicted the bruises by herself finally tony tells margot to deny that he told her not to call the police although he tells her that it will lessen the police suspicion it has the opposite effect making it appear as though she avoided calling the policeeventually the police establish that swann came in through the hall door rather than the french windows leading into the garden as his shoes are not dirty after an intermission we are introduced to inspector hubbard john williams who questions the wendices and appears to believe the evidence that tony planted eventually becoming highly suspicious of margot the movie cuts immediately to the trial scene where she is convicted and sentenced to be hanged thus accomplishing tonys plan after allhowever there are two things tony has not reckoned with a that swann replaced the key under the stair carpet immediately after using it to open the door and accordingly the key he takes out of the dead mans pocket is the key to swanns own flat and b that getting rid of £1000 in cash the money he would have paid to swann which he does not have to now that he is dead by making many purchases is a conspicuous thing to do and bound to be investigated by the police which it is although tony is not aware of thisseveral months later on the day before margots scheduled execution mark visits tony to propose a very unusual thing to him rather than seeing his wife hanged he could come up with a completely new story confess at the last minute that he hired swann to kill his wife and save her life by going to prison for some years himself instead coincidentally mark has come up with exactly what tony actually did mark argues that during margots trial all arguments revolved around three things only 1 marks letter found on swann 2 the fact that no key was found on swann and that there was no forced entry either and 3 margots stocking mark argues that all this could be altered and that tony could put all the blame on himself claiming that it was he who had done all thatthen inspector hubbard arrives at the flat again purportedly to ask tony about the money he has been spending lately this is when mark discovers tonys attaché case filled with the remaining one pound notes and presents it to hubbard when he inquires to tony about the suitcase pressed for an answer tony manages a final impromptu lie in front of both mark and inspector hubbard he tells them this is the money margot had ready when she met swann but that she changed her mind and killed him instead of paying him off the inspector accepts this explanation and dismisses marks theory or so it seemsin fact the inspector who has not given up the case yet remains suspicious of tony and sets a trap he borrows the key from margots handbag which is kept in prison and goes to tonys flat while tony is not home he finds that it does not fit the lock he discovers that the key actually fits swanns door after some searching he discovers the actual key under the carpetthen the inspector uses his final trick he visits tony to ask some questions and when he leaves he deliberately takes tonys raincoat instead of his own the raincoats are apparently very similar and so are the keys tony also leaves his flat inspector hubbard secretly enters the flat using the key from the raincoat telephones the prison and asks that margot be released margot who does not understand why she has been released goes home and finds that the key in her handbag does not fit the lock hubbard waits some time he wants to find out whether she knows the hiding place under the stair carpet she does not so that clears her of any suspicion the inspector opens the door for her hubbard tells a colleague to take the handbag back to the police station hubbard and margot then wait for tonys homecomingwhen tony comes home he realizes that he cannot get inside he is wearing hubbards raincoat with hubbards key hubbard and margot along with mark hide themselves inside and do not open the door then tony remembers that he had been told to collect margots belongings from the police station so he goes there to fetch her handbag with the key when he comes home he finds that the key from margots handbag  actually swanns  does not fit into the lock tony starts thinking what could have happened when he takes the key from under the stair carpet he gives himself awaytony enters the room to find margot and the inspector and mark too he realizes hes been found out and congratulates the inspector after appearing surprised that he has finally been found out tony then offers everyone a drink acting very casual as tears begin to stream down his wifes face the last scene is of the inspector acting in a manner that shows hes proud of himself as he combs his mustache as he makes a phone
