ultimate demolition of a metaphorical wall though the films symbolism is open to interpretation the wall itself clearly reflects a sense of isolation and alienationpink bob geldof the protagonist and unreliable narrator of the film is a rock star one of several reasons behind his apparent depressive and detached emotional state he is first seen in a quiet hotel room having trashed it the opening
