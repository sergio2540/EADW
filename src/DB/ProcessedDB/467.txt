robert de niros debuts as director in this feature and he does a fine job with obvious scorsese influence this is an excellent smallscale movie with a good story and welldeveloped characters some excellent performances along with subtle directorial flair
in a lot of ways movie this resembles a softer gentler goodfellas the story revolves around calogero anello a seventeen year old italian growing up in a 1960s bronx neighborhood played by lillo brancato calogero is befriended by the local mob boss palminteri over the objections of his father de niro and this movie tells the story of his coming of age in this environment capra does a fine job as a nine yearold calogero and palminteri and de niro show excellence at their craft brancato does a respectable job but suffers from comparison
this is a personal favorite of mine and i recommend it wholeheartedly there are some wonderful scenes strong dialogue and enough action to balance out the story and make this enjoyable by all kinds of viewers 7.8gangster bus racism 1960s bar racist african american money place name in title biker gang confession child swearing cadillac convertible murder witness produced by director little boy molotov cocktail bus driver obscene finger gesture police lineup morality racial slur genuflecting violence 11 passes in a row stickball italian american nostalgia betting on a horse reference to mickey mantle kissing in public father son relationship blacks versus italians year 1968 childhood memory shot multiple times shot in the head interracial relationship baseball bat understanding directed by star friendship immolation fixing a bicycle pat on the head racial violence generation gap black american new york city prayer loyalty interracial romance yankees baseball cap narrated by character first love reference to rocky marciano funeral bouquet burned to death role model coming of age work breaking a car windshield child uses drugs urban setting murder horse race funeral confessional u turn wolf whistle sprayed with beer gambling bronx new york city motorcycle gang public transit produced by actor fire burned bodies affection craps tip brutality car white male black female relationship boxing match coffin racial intolerance first kiss reference to the beatles sicilian crap game mob boss mob execution based on play based on true story independent film
