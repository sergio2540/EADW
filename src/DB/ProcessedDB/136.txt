idealistic jefferson smith leader of the boy rangers is appointed on a lark by the spineless governor of his state he is reunited with the states senior senatorpresidential hopeful and childhood hero senator joseph paine in washington however smith discovers many of the shortcomings of the political process as his earnest goal of a national boys camp leads to a conflict with the state political boss jim taylor taylor first tries to corrupt smith and then later attempts to destroy smith through a scandal the governor of an unnamed western state hubert happy hopper guy kibbee has to pick a replacement for recently deceased us senator sam foley his corrupt political boss jim taylor edward arnold pressures hopper to choose his handpicked stooge while popular committees want a reformer the governors children want him to select jefferson smith james stewart the head of the boy rangers unable to make up his mind between taylors stooge and the reformer hopper decides to flip a coin when it lands on edge and next to a newspaper story on one of smiths accomplishments he chooses smith calculating that his wholesome image will please the people while his naïveté will make him easy to manipulatesmith is taken under the wing of the publicly esteemed but secretly crooked senator joseph paine claude rains who was smiths late fathers oldest and best friend and he develops an immediate attraction to the senators daughter susan astrid allwyn the unforgiving washington press quickly labels smith a bumpkin with no business being a senator paine to keep smith busy suggests he propose a billsmith comes up with legislation that would authorize a federal government loan to buy some land in his home state for a national boys camp to be paid back by youngsters across america donations pour in immediately however the proposed campsite is already part of a dambuilding graft scheme included in a public works bill framed by the taylor political machine and supported by senator paineunwilling to crucify the worshipful smith so that their graft plan will go through paine tells taylor he wants out but taylor reminds him that paine is in power primarily through taylors influence through paine the machine accuses smith of trying to profit from his bill by producing fraudulent evidence that smith owns the land in question smith is too shocked by paines betrayal to defend himself and runs awayhowever smiths chief of staff clarissa saunders jean arthur has come to believe in him and talks him into launching a filibuster to postpone the works bill and prove his innocence on the senate floor just before the vote to expel him while smith talks nonstop his constituents try to rally around him but the entrenched opposition is too powerful and all attempts are crushed due to influence of the taylor machine on his orders newspapers and radio stations in smiths home state refuse to report what smith has to say and even twist the facts against the senator an effort by the boy rangers to spread the news results in vicious attacks on the children by taylors minionsalthough all hope seems lost the senators begin to pay attention as smith approaches utter exhaustion paine has one last card up his sleeve he brings in bins of letters and telegrams from smiths home state from people demanding his expulsion nearly broken by the news smith finds a small ray of hope in a friendly smile from the president of the senate harry carey smith vows to press on until people believe him but immediately collapses in a faint overcome with guilt paine leaves the senate chamber and attempts to kill himself with a gun when he is stopped he bursts back into the senate chamber loudly confesses to the whole scheme and affirms smiths innocence 8.3political
