try his new serum on himself it seems to work perfectly in seconds he loses 250 pounds and becomes slim and fit however with his new body sherman also develops a split personality as well  the high testosterone levels causing his new personality to be overly confident and assertive as well as demonstrating a desire to resort to violence on more than one occasionthe following day while still slim he starts to flirt with carla who comes to the lab looking for sherman quickly inventing the name buddy love for his new alter ego  based on a security guards saying hey buddy what the hell happened here although love is his own contribution he invites carla back to the scream however the serum then begins to wear off ie one hand bulking up and his voice returning to normal and he ushers carla out carla later tells sherman about buddy and sherman encourages her to go out with him at the scream buddy turns up very late in a brand new dodge viper and persuades an angry carla who is about to leave to go back inside this time when reggie appears buddy heckles him mercilessly fires off a barrage of jokes about his mothers weight and finally takes the stage himself performing a piece from minnie ripertons 1975 hit lovin you and forcing reggie to do minnies signature highpitched squeal before throwing the comedian into a pianobuddy returns to carla who is delighted with him he gives a waiter a credit card to pay for the meal buddy and carla then share a kiss immediately after the serum begins to wear off and buddy makes a quick exit attributing it to an allergic reaction to carlas lipstick the bulking up beginning with his lower lip jason happens to be at the bar and notes that the card buddy is using belongs to sherman he follows buddy into the sports car to confront him only to learn shermans secret when he discovers him in midtransformation culminating in shermans having to be cut out of the car when he becomes too big to use the doorthe next morning sherman is very late for a class and his students have all left the dean however is there and he confronts sherman about the sports car which buddy bought on shermans faculty account the dean threatens to strangle sherman and cut off your air supply until you pass away if he screws up again and asks him to meet hartley at a hotel restaurant called the ritz to describe the weightloss serumlater in the lab jason tells sherman that he cant control buddy whose testosterone levels keep rising using his outofcharacter attitude as buddy as an example he warns him not to use the serum again and to focus instead on the research for hartley later carla talks to sherman about her date with buddy and sherman takes the opportunity to ask carla to dinner with his family who promptly embarrass him by making various suggestive comments about their relationship and cletus farts again his confidence low and after carla mentions that she would like the opportunity to get to know the caring person she sometimes sees in buddys eyes he uses the serum again jason tries to stop buddy but to no avail sherman tries to communicate to jason from deep down inside buddy and instructs jason to go into the storage closet to get an antidote but the muscled don juan regains control and locks jason in before departingbuddy who is becoming ever more aggressive takes carla out on a second date  this time to the hotel where sherman was to meet hartley the dean looking for sherman asks carla if she knows where sherman is but carla asks buddy if he could take shermans place with the dean desperate to get the grant he allows buddy to talk to hartley but with buddy subsequently taking all the credit for the work hartley and the dean are both impressed the dean later asking if buddy would be willing to fill in for sherman on a more permanent basisbuddy then picks up three beautiful women at the hotel and invites carla to participate in some group action which quickly prompts her to dump him undaunted he throws a loud party at shermans house that night burning all the health food products in the fridge having transformed back to his normal self during the night sherman awakens to find himself surrounded by strange women he has no memory of the previous night and is stunned to find the whole house in disarraycarla arrives shortly thereafter to tell sherman that she has left buddy and to apologize about her encouraging buddy to talk to hartley one of the women from the hotel the night before comes out of shermans room asking for buddy and carla thinks sherman is as unfaithful as buddy to the extent that the two of them actually share women to add to shermans problems as he chases after her he finds an eviction notice taped to his front door by his unseen grouchy downstairs neighbor and landlord mr wilson owing to all the noise buddy and the party had made during the night jason then enters the scene and tells sherman that they need to go to the lab trying to collect himself sherman tells jason that it needs to wait until later however jason stresses that there wont be a later and a visit to the lab soon confirms that dean richmond has fired sherman replaced him with buddy given him shermans ticket to the alumni ball and gloatingly promises to ruin shermanat home depressed sherman accidentally activates the vcr where buddy has left a message taunting sherman and encouraging him to take the serum once again this inspires sherman to take his life back resolved to prove that he can defeat buddy he and jason start destroying all the serum samples but when he sips a diet drink that buddy has craftily filled with the serum he transforms again buddy who has taken on a life of his own with a vengeance tells jason that he has calculated that if he drinks 500 ml of the serum he will have enough cellular stability to be thin forever thus killing sherman however he cannot drink all of that serum at once as it would literally kill sherman and therefore buddy too buddy however has a plan to drink 250 ml of the serum while still in the lab and the other 250 at the alumni ball he then knocks jason out and heads to the alumni ball to carry out his plan which will simultaneously prove the validity of shermans researchbuddy arrives at the ball three hours late and starts acting rowdily to the disgrace of dean richmond who scolds him for not being there on time buddy responds by threatening the dean in the same way he threatened sherman by strangling him to death he then begins to make his way to the stage where his plan will be put into placeback at the lab jason regains consciousness just in time to see a warning on the lab computer that buddys testosterone levels are at a lethally high 60000 and darts out of the lab to head for the ball there buddy begins to demonstrate the effects of the serum to the amazed audience which includes the dean carla hartley and shermans parents allowing himself to briefly bulk up just enough to demonstrate how one sip of the serum is effective enough to make him thin then as he prepares to drink the second dose of serum to stay buddy love forever jason runs in and tries to stop him buddy punches jason but jason hits backas buddy stands poised to return a blow sherman starts to fight him for control of his body fat and thin body parts beginning with his right fist and subsequently varying around the rest of his body alternate with increasing speed while buddys voice shouts you cant beat me and shermans voice replies yes i can eventually after a violent transformationconfrontation sherman wins the struggle still on stage he tells the awed alumni that while he started out wanting to help people what he did was selfish and foolish and that he has learned that the important thing is to accept himself as he is rather than being unhappy about how much he weighs he leaves but carla stops him and asks him why he lied he explains that he did not believe that she would accept him but she assures him that it does not matter if he is overweight or not carla asks him to dance and he agrees jason subsequently arriving with a tuxedo that fits the two subsequently dance for the rest of the night much to the approval of jason and shermans family hartley then tells the dean that hes decided to give sherman the grant because hes a brilliant scientist and a gentleman 5.5teacher professor formula
