jones barry rohrssen leigh french george cheung murphy dunne dana lee julie payne gregory snegoff skipp lynch times are tough in a chicago realestate office the salesmen shelley levene ricky roma dave moss and george aaronow are given a strong incentive by blake to succeed in a sales contest the prizes first prize is a cadillac el dorado second prize is a set of steak knives third prize is the sack there is no room for losers in this dramatically masculine world only closers will get the good sales leads there is a lot of pressure to succeed so a robbery is committed which has unforeseen consequences for all the characters act ithe movie begins in a chinese restaurant somewhere in chicago with character shelley levene jack lemmon a veteran real estate salesman attempting to contact a doctor for his daughter in the phone booth next to him is dave moss ed harris attempting to sell properties in rio rancho estates florida they both go into the mens room and start complaining about the type of potential customers or leads they have been getting from their sales company they exit the bathroom and ricky roma al pacino is successfully selling real estate to a man at the bar when they return to their office a representative a hottempered arrogant businessman called blake alec baldwin in a role written just for the movie not in the original stage play sent by the owners of the company they work for mitch and murray is there he berates them over their poor sales and announces a contest in which the bestselling salesman gets a cadillac and the worst performing salesman is fired the salesmen themselves blame their lack of sales on the poor quality of the leads they have gotten blake then tells them that he has some premium leads for sales in a new development the glengarry leads these are buyers who are both likely to buy and able to afford the land they are selling so getting these leads is incredibly important to all the salesmen blake tells them that the leads will go to the best performing salesmen probably to roma at firstshelley is so distraught with the situation that he confronts office boss mr williamson kevin spacey about providing him with the better leads he takes advantage of shelleys vulnerable situation by offering to sell him the better leads at fifty dollars a piece as well as a cut of 20 of all his profits shelley is unable to afford this and is stuck attempting to sell his secondrate leadsthe movie then skips to dave moss and coworker george aaronow alan akrin going to a local diner across town and talking about the unethical behavior of their employer williamson and about their mean and ungrateful rep blake over their sales work moss proposes that they strike back at mitch and murray by stealing all the glengarry leads and sell them to jerry graff a competing real estate agency for 7500 mosss plan would require aaronow to break into the office stage a burglary and steal all the prime leads aaronow wants no part of the plan but moss tries to coerce him saying that aaronow is already an accomplice simply because he knows about the proposed robbery aaronow continues to declinemeanwhile ricky roma is selling real estate to a meek middleaged man named james lingk jonathon pryce back at the chinese restaurant by promising financial success in investing roma does not broach the subject of a real estate deal until he has completely won lingk over with his speech framing it as being an opportunity rather than a purchase roma plays upon lingks feelings of complacency and insecurityact iithe next day the salesmen come into work to find that the office has been burglarized and the glengarry leads have been stolen williamson and the police question each of the salesmen in private it would appear that aaronow and moss have done it due to their nervous attitudes as a police inspector interviews each of them one by one in mr williamsons office roma is especially distraught because he was the only one whose successful selling entitled him to the glengarry leads everyone is in a terrible mood except for levene who reveals that he managed to sell 82000 in property the night before he explains his success story to roma who listens with great respect and happiness for his coworker the negative tone in the office overshadows levenes great sell after his interrogation moss leaves in disgust only after having one explosive last encounter with romaduring the cycle of interrogations first with moss then with aaronow and then to levene lingk arrives at the office to tell roma that his wife has told him to cancel the deal they made the night before because they can ill afford the sale scrambling to salvage the deal roma tries to deceive lingk by telling him that the check he wrote the night before has yet to be cashed and that accordingly he has time to reason with his wife and reconsider all the while levene abets roma by claiming to be a wealthy investor and friend of romas who just happens to be on his way to the airport and is dependant on roma for a ride williamson unaware of roma and levenes stalling tactic lies to lingk claiming that he already deposited his check in the bank upset lingk rushes out of the office threatening to contact the states attorney for legal action and roma berates williamson for what he has done roma then enters williamsons office to take his turn being interrogated by the police alone with williamson levene still giddy and proud of the large sale he made that morning takes the opportunity to mock williamson in private levene further yells at mr williamson for costing romas sale commission and tells him not to make things up unless it helps with businesssuddenly the tables turn when williamson firmly asks levene how do you know i made it up uhoh in his zeal to emasculate williamson as he has done to him several times levene inadvertently revealed that he knew williamson was lying to roma on the spur of the moment about taking lingks check to the bank and that williamson actually left lingks check on his desk and did not make the bank run the previous night something only the man who broke into the office would know williamson catches levenes slipup quickly and compels levene to admit that he broke into the office levene tries laughing it off but he eventually breaks down and admits that he indeed broke into the office because he and moss conspired to steal the glengary leads to sell to jerry groff apparently levene ended up being moss accomplice in the plan after aaronow which levene apparently does not know about had turned down moss offer levene explains that the current situation has made him realize that being a salesman is what he was meant to do in life mr williamson tells shelley levene that his big sale has an incredible client credibility and that he is a terrible salesmanmr williamson tells levene that he is finished and he will turn him into the authorities levene attempts to bargain with mr williamson but williamson reveals to levene that the buyers to whom he made the 82000 sale earlier are in fact crazy and have no money and that he has no interest in helping levene with anything for the simple reason that williamson dislikes him the film ends as levene walks defeated into williamsons office where the police are waiting roma walks out of the office for lunch and aaronow sits alone
