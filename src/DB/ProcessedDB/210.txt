mercenary wearing a fedora and leather jacket finds the cross of coronado a priceless spanish american artifact indy believing it belongs in a museum takes it and is pursued attempting to escape by horseback he is followed by the mercenaries in autos but boards a circus train to elude them while on the train he crawls through a car full of snakes thereby providing the backstory for his reptilophobia and then finds himself in a car with a lion from whom he escapes by using a bullwhip he finds hanging on the wall in which his first attempt backlashes and gives him a cut on his chin explaining the origin of his scar a real scar borne by actor harrison ford after a few more dangerous encounters including a near castration by the horn of a rhinoceros annoyed by the tussle on his roof indy gets the cross home where his father is busy working on drawing what looks like a stained glass window when indy excitedly tries to tell his father about it his father rebuffs him telling him to calm down by counting to 10 in greekmoments later a fellow scout whom indy had sent for the sheriff when he discovered the illegal dig returns with the lawman but he is dismayed to find that the burly businessman wearing a panama hat who had hired the mercenaries had also bought the law and indy is forced to surrender the cross to the looters however before the head mercenary leaves the house he says to indy you lost this time kid but you dont have to like itand puts the fedora on the boys head as indy smiles the scene fades and the scene changes to 1938 aboard a freighter in a violent atlantic storm indy has tracked down the cross but is again confronted by the man in the panama hat and his henchmen he grabs the artifact fights off the crew and dives into the ocean scant seconds before a massive wave collapses the ships funnel causing it to fall onto a load of explosives as indy grabs a life preserver from the wreck he sees the panama hat floating by as the hulk of the ship sinks the name is visible on the bow coronadoindy returns to his university and after a moment of comic relief almost identical to the similar scene in raiders of the lost ark gives the artifact marcus brody for the museum then goes to his office where he is surrounded by a phalanx of students his secretary irene gives him a ream of papers to be graded as well as phone messages and a brown paper package from venice which he puts in his pocket after sitting for a moment in his artifact cluttered office he sneaks out through his window but is greeted by three men who step from a sinister black sedan they ask him to accompany them to what seems to be an elegant penthouse apartment in an unnamed city this is the home of walter donovan a generous donator to the museum donovan is apparently an oil magnate whose drilling team has uncovered fragment of a stone marker dating to the 12th century the marker is read by indy and to his surprise it details the cup that holds the blood of jesus christ  the holy grail whose waters can grant immortality donovans project leader has deduced that a second marker left behind by a knight who had found the grail is somewhere in venice but a major snag has occurred as the project leader and all his research have vanished to the concern of his assistant doctor elsa schneiderto indys surprise his father is donovans project leader and when indy and marcus find henrys house ransacked and his mail opened indy suddenly remembers the package he got from venice  his dads diary in which is all his fathers research on the grailindy and marcus fly to venice where donovan has arranged apartments for them and they meet with schneider she gives them a written note by henry that contains only the roman numerals for three seven and ten then the group goes to where henry disappeared the venice library which was once a church in ancient roman times a glass painting dating from the sacking of byzantium gives indy a clue that the library is the tomb of the knight indy pries open the floor and finds a network of tunnels containing oil exploring the tunnel with elsa  and in the process passing a wall painting of ancient antiquities such as the ark of the covenant  indy finds an ancient casket and a knights shield the second markerhowever marcus is slugged by members of a cult sworn to preventing discovery of the grail and who have followed indy from the states the cult sets fire to the oil in the tunnels but indy and elsa escape through the city sewers indy and elsa are pursued by the cultists on speedboats before indy dispatches one boat and corners the groups leader and learns from him that henry is held in a castle in germanylater after drying out indy arranges for marcus to meet sallah to begin finding the grail while he and elsa go after henry he finds that his room and elsas have been ransacked by men looking for the grail diary making him all the more determined to find henry and also the grail the two fly to the german castle and indy finds henry but both are double crossed by elsa and to both mens horror they find that the stringpuller in this whole affair is walter donovan who wants the ancient cup to give him immortality indy and henry are bound in the castle but indy manages to break out in the process setting off a fire he and henry commandeer a nazi motorcyle and escape pursuing german soldiers but henry stops indys trek of escape to make him go back to berlin where donovan and elsa have taken his diary for hitler when indy demands to know why the diary is so important henry explains that it details traps that protect the grail and keys to defeating them indy also confronts his father about his obsession with the grail and receives a slap from his father when he blasphemesindy and his father trek to berlin finds elsa standing with hitler and his highest staff at a nazi party book burning indy retrieves the diary in the process tempted to strangle her during his departure from the rally indy comes facetoface with hitler himself who adds his signature to the bookindy and his father got to the berlin flughafen to escape indy books tickets aboard a dirigible however they are forced to leave the dirigible using the search plane attached underneath they are chased by luftwaffe fighters and are forced to land when indys father shoots the tail off their plane with its machine bun they escape one plane that crashes into a tunnel then henry suddenly remembers my charlemegne that drives him to send seagulls flying into the path of the second fighter which flies into the swarm and crashesreaching the desert area of jordan indy and henry rendezvous with indys pal sallah where they learn that marcus whom indy had given a map from the diary leading them to the grail itself was captured by nazi agents and taken to donovan tracking down donovans exploration group indy henry and sallah see it is escorted by a company of nazi troopers with a world war ivintage tank when desert guerrillas led by the group that attacked indy in venice ambush the convoy henry uses the cover to try and rescue marcus but both are seized by the nazis indy pursues the tank and a prolonged fight ensues where marcus and henry attack the soldiers inside and by a mixture of clumsiness and force succeed in killing them then use the tank to blast the convoy indy rescues the two of them but the tank drives off a sheer cliff indy barely escapingthe four men soon track down donovans remaining group at a cliffside temple petra in which is the path to the grail the traps within have already killed several of donovans group and when indy and his pals are seized donovan sees indy as his chance to force indy to find the grail donovan shoots henry leaving the healing power of the grail as the only chance to save henrys life indy thus enters the dangerous pathway deducing how to avoid its traps and finding the chamber of the grail he succeeds in reaching the grail chamber and must choose the correct grail from many false oneshowever donovan and elsa enter before he can and elsa chooses a cup for donovan she knows it is an incorrect choice and donovan ultimately ages to death for drinking from the wrong grail indy then picks the true grail drinks from it proving it to be the true one and is warned by the and uses it to heal henrys wound all is settled until elsa decides to leave with the grail setting off a mammoth quake inside the vast temple elsa hits the ground and the grail rolls into a large fissure in the temple elsa almost falls in herself but is saved by indy at the last moment elsa instead of letting indy lift her up pulls one of her hands free to try and reach the grail resting below her she can almost touch it and so she keeps on reaching despite indys pleads to give him both her hands he cannot maintain his grip on elsas slippery leather gloved hand and before elsa can grasp the cup her hand slips out of its leather glove elsa falls to her death and indy near does too but his father catches him indy tries to reach the grail himself but henry gets through to him and the two ultimately escape the temple when jones sr calls indy junior sallah asks what it means jones sr tells him indys full name henry jones jr a moniker that indy himself detests jones sr also reveals that indiana was the name of their dog when indy was a child sallah finds
