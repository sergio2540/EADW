is perfected a new type of law enforcement agency is formed its called time enforcement commission or tec a cop max walker is assigned to the group on the day he was chosen some men attack him and kill his wife ten years later max is still grieving but has become a good agent for the tec he tracks down a former coworker who went into the past to make money max brings him back for sentencing but not after telling max that senator mccomb the man in charge of tec sent him max has his eye on mccomb the perfection of time travel brings with it new opportunities for criminals the government sets up a special police force tec to ensure the new technology isnt abused max walker one of these timecops learns of a corrupt politicians plot to become president using the device senator mccomb discovers walker on his trail and the real action beginsin walkers own past in washington dc in 1994 the senate oversight committee soc is being spoken to in the capitol building by george spota who explains that for the past 20 years doctor hans kleindast the nobel laureate who help the government with the space program back in the 1960s and 1970s has been doing research and his field of research has been time travel the soc believes that hans is a quack  until george tells the soc that hans actually succeeded in his research and took a trip to the past then back to the present you cant travel into the future because the future hasnt happened yet george makes it clear that a covert agency is needed to police time travel so the time enforcement commission tec is formed named as the director of the tec is commander eugene matuzak formerly of the washington dc police department senator aaron mccomb who sees possibilities agrees to chair the oversight on the new program sometime later at a shopping center tec agent max walker and his wife melissa are being watched by a pair of shady looking men later at home max and melissa spend some passionate time together that night melissa is about to tell max something extremely important when the phone rings max answers the phone and is told to go to tec headquarters max gets dressed and as soon as max opens the front door to go outside he is attacked by the two men from the shopping center as the two men are beating max up max sees aaron looking out the window of the bedroom that melissa is still in and aaron is holding melissa hostage forcing melissa to watch maxs beating the two men outside then shoot max who is wearing a bulletproof vest  and then an explosion engulfs the house killing melissa on october 30 1929 on wall street in new york city a man named lyle atwood enters an office building and rides an elevator up to an office there is a sudden ripple in the office and max enters from the future it turns out that lyle is maxs partner and lyle is planning to stop the depression from happening max wants to know who lyle is working for and lyie calls two security men into the office to deal with max max beats up the two security men and lyle pulls out a gun and opens fire on max when lyle runs out of bullets max forces lyle to admit that hes working for aaron and that aaron has paid off a lot of other tec agents as well lyle then jumps out the window max jumps out after lyle grabs him and takes lyle with him back to present time which is now the year 2004 ten years after melissas murder tec judge marshall sentences lyle to be immediately executed so lyle is sent back to 1929 and is dropped to his death from the point in midair where max and lyle disappeared to 2004 at tec headquarters in 2004 aaron max and matuzak are showing senator malcolm nelson around the tec building aaron reminds everyone that people who go back in time risk coming into contact with a past version of themselves the same matter cannot occupy the same space at the same time because if that happens and if its a person accidentally making physical contact with their past version that person will die and their body will disappear from the face of the earth later max tells matuzak that aaron wants to shut down the tec so no one can stop him from altering the past to his advantage because aaron is now running for president of the united states aarons fading campaign for president is dealt a blow when he is denied federal campaign matching funds just before max wakes up two men break into his home to kill him but max turns the tables and kills the two men who broke in tec internal affairs investigator sarah fielding questions max max soon learns that sarah may be on the wrong side in this max must travel back and forth in time to bring aaron downand when max goes back to 1994 and finds out what melissa wanted to tell him 10 years ago it gives max incentive to at least try to
