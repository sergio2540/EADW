nikki simbi khali nikki comes on to justice but he turns her down and leaves

bumping and screaming in nikkis bedroom the next morning rita finds
that nikki has split with all her belongings and theres a note saying
that shes getting an apartment with a man she just met rita assumes it
is justice and she becomes very jealoustime is growing short max has to start using drastic measures like
taking on the personas of other people such as preacher pauly and stupid
guido in order to get closer to rita but maxs plans seem to backfire so
he takes the direct route and saves her from being run over by a speeding
taxi in gratitude rita accepts a dinner date with him max hurries back
to juliuss apartment and casts every spell he knows to change it from a
pigsty to an elegant lovenest complete with candelabras fireplace and a
baby grand piano he finally manages to get his dance with rita as well as
a bite on her neckjulius is enjoying the benefits of working for a vampire eg
driving the black limo with vanity plates that say rip he is also
having to adjust to the sideeffects eg acquiring a taste for bugs and
losing parts of his body first his ear then his right hand then his
hair then an eye then his whole right armmeanwhile justice is following up a lead that suggests julius might
have been involved in the killing of the two thugs a few nights ago the

silas green who tells him that rita was there all night with the new
tenant some suave guy just then justice receives a call from the
