notsopopular position with some of the locals in clanton mississippi ellen roark a stellar law student from ole miss offers her services to jake just for the opportunity to help with the case and eventually convinces him to take her on in the meantime the kkk at the prompting of a brother of one of the rapists plants burning crosses on jakes lawn attempts to bomb his house and takes a shot at him to ensure their safety jake sends his wife and little daughter to gulfport to stay with his inlaws as tension in canton reaches fever pitch and the naacp and kkk riot on the courthouse lawn a

hailey raeven larrymore kelly in rural mississippi they violently rape and beat tonya and dump her in a nearby river after a failed attempt to hang her she survives and the men are arrestedtonyas father carl lee hailey samuel l jackson seeks out jake brigance matthew mcconaughey an easygoing white lawyer carl lee is worried that the men may be acquitted due to deepseated racism in the mississippi delta area they discuss a similar case further south in which four white teenagers were acquitted of the rape of a black girl brigance admits the possibility that the rapists will walk free in this case as well carl lee acquires an m16 rifle goes to the county courthouse and opens fire this results in the deaths of both rapists and also in the unintended injury of deputy looney chris cooper who has to have his leg amputated carl lee is soon arrested without resistance brigance agrees to provide defense for carl lee for a much smaller amount of money than such a trial would usually require he intends to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of temporary insanitythe rape and subsequent revenge killing gain national media attention the ku klux klan begins to organize in the area freddie lee cobb kiefer sutherland the brother of billy ray calls brigance and his family with death threats and organizes the formation of a klan chapter in the county the district attorney rufus buckley kevin spacey decides to seek the death penalty and presiding judge omar noose patrick mcgoohan denies brigance a change of venue brigance seeks help for his defense team from sleazy divorce lawyer and close friend harry rex vonner oliver platt he seeks guidance from longtime liberal activist lucien wilbanks donald sutherland a oncegreat civil rights lawyer who was disbarred for violence on a picket linebrigance is approached by ellen roark sandra bullock a fiery liberal law student from massachusetts who belongs to the aclu brigance is initially reluctant to accept ellens cooperation but he later agrees to let her help with the case the trial begins amid much attention from the media and public the klan which has a member inside the sheriffs department burns a cross on brigances lawn this incident causes an argument between brigance and his wife to the effect that if jake had heeded carl lees warning this would not have happened the police evacuate jakes family from their house brigance and the police capture one of the klan members and they find a case with a bomb inside it brigance throws the bomb into the air where it explodes this motivates jake to send his wife and young daughter away while the trial continuesas the trial begins the kkk march down cantons streets and meet a large group of mostly black protesters at the courthouse chaos ensues outside the courthouse as the police lose control of the crowd a black teenager kills the kkk grand dragon kurtwood smith with a molotov cocktail burning him to death brigances attraction to roark grows and they nearly begin an affair before brigance regains his wits he goes home finding that arsonists have burned down his house nearly killing his dog max in the process the next morning as the mississippi national guard is called in to take care of the rioting brigance sits on the stillsmoking steps of his house calling for his dog harry rex arrives at the remains of the brigance home and tells jake that it is time to quit the case brigance argues that to quit now would make his sacrifices meaningless the jury secretly discusses the case in a restaurant going against the judges instructions all but one are leaning toward a guilty verdict and carl lees fate looks sealedfreddie lee cobb shoots at brigance as he exits the courthouse but misses the bullet hits a national guardsman policing the demonstrations paralyzing him roark is kidnapped by klansmen beaten tied to a stake in the wilderness in her underwear and left to die she is saved by an informant called mickey mouse who is one of the klansmen tim nunley john diehl out of options brigance goes to see carl lee in his jail cell and advises accepting a lesser guilty plea carl lee refuses and rejects brigances notions of race and justice noting that although brigance considers himself a friend to carl lee brigance has never visited his home and that our kids will never play together carl lee tells brigance that he chose brigance to be his attorney because brigance is in fact his enemy as brigance is white and was thus raised amid the same racial prejudices harbored by the jury members carl lee tells brigance to sway the jury by presenting to them whatever argument it would take to get brigance himself to vote for acquittal were brigance a member of that jurythe courthouse is packed to see the attorneys closing arguments brigance tells the jury to close their eyes and listen to a story he describes in slow and painful detail the rape of a young 10yearold girl mirroring the story of tonyas rape he then asks the jury in his final comment to now imagine shes white this final burst of imagery challenges the very nature of the trial itself raising the very real specter  within the racist culture of the community in which the crime took place  that the actions of hailey would not have been called to question before the court of law had the victim been white had it been so it is implied that the fathers motive in murdering the rapists would have been seen by the public as justified and there would not have been any prosecutionthe argument brigance then makes is that if the jury can  at any time  be compelled to spare the life of a white man for a vengeful murder then they must be able to do the same for a black man after deliberation an africanamerican child runs out of the courthouse and screams hes innocent jubilation ensues amongst the supporters outside the kkk enraged become violent again sheriff ozzie walls charles s dutton arrests freddie lee as well as his own racist deputy the movie ends when brigance brings his wife and daughter to a family cookout at carl lees house carl lee is surprised and standoffish jake explains just thought our kids could play
