problemuntil alexs radiator begins to overheat and the car stalls
they walk back a few blocks to a gas station but its closing and the
attendant refuses to sell them any antifreeze alex suggests that they
might get help from his exgirlfriend adia tina kapousis who lives a few blocks away
while walking there however they are attacked by two punks one of whom
stabs alex in the stomach as the punk gloats and ryan and jt fear for
their lives alex suddenly rises up and kills both punks by biting them in
the necks it is thus that ryan and jt discover that alex is a vampireso is adia shes also an alcoholic and she has taken up with a new
guy a vampire named slain jason bouwer who works in a blood bank and who brings
dinner every night slain is not there so adia loans slains car to alex
while they drive to an open gas station to get antifreeze the trunk on
slains car comes loose alex stops the car to close it and finds in the
trunk a body and an icechest of blood worse yet the stake through the
bodys heart tells alex that it belongs to a vampire furthermore the
blood in the bottles all marked by blood type is vampire blood alex can
tell by the smell it appears that the vampire slain is killing other
vampires for their blood but whymore important at the moment is the fact that slain is living with
adia a vampire vampirekiller living with a vampire so alex hurriedly
telephones adia and warns her to get out of the house unfortunately
slain has already come home and knowing that adia has loaned out his car
rewards her with a stake through the heart alex arrives and tries to
revive adia but its too late as alex is rifling through adias room
looking for information about slain he comes upon a list of names  four
vampires three of whom are dead and their blood types only marcus thoel
remainsassuming that marcus thoel is slains next target the boys go
looking for him first stop is the local vamp bar bram stokers
cheers where alex visits with clyde  eric jaan the gay vampire who turned him
clyde has not heard of slain but he is able to provide marcus address
when they arrive at marcus house however they find that slain has
already been there marcus is dead even worse he was tortured before he
was staked alex concludes that it was marcus who turned slain and that
this killing was done out of revenge as much as for marcus type o blood
suddenly it all fits together in alexs mind slain is a new vampire who
is in pain because of being turned so he is collecting blood from
vampires in order to contaminate the blood at the blood bank and turn all
recipients into vampires so that they can also feel his pain just like an
aids victim who goes around giving the virus to othersafter figuring out at which blood bank slain works the boys head
over they get there just as slain is tainting human blood with drops of
vampire blood big fight in which alex succeeds in staking slain slains
last words thank you since its only a little after 1 am the boys
