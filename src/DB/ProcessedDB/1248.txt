but she is having problems sometimes she doesnt remember what shes seen until later one night she is awakened by a commotion upstairs peering out of her door she sees a shadowy figure descending the stairs convinced that her neighbour has been murdered she approaches the police only to find that she is unsure if it was just her new eyes playing tricks on her twenty years ago 8yearold emma brodys abusive mother smashed emmas face into a bathroom mirror just for pilfering in the mothers makeup drawer today emma is an independent selfassured woman who plays violin in a popular celtic folk band in chicago emma lives life on her own terms only without sight  the result of the traumatic injuries to her eyes at the hands of her mother luckily for emma medical science has vaulted a quantum leap in the past two decades now thanks to corneal implants installed by her kindly eye surgeon dr ryan pierce emma can see again emmas sight is at first cloudy and she suffers from retroactive hallucinations a clinically documented syndrome in which the newly sighted sometimes see things hours or even days after they actually happen this becomes a big problem when emma sees a suspicious man leaving her neighbors apartment at 4am but his features appear to her only in flashback later that morning after failing to get a response at the neighbors door emma tries to convince detective john hallstrom and his partner tom ridgely to check things out at first hallstrom dismisses emma as a nutcase but when the cops finally arrive on the scene they find the guy murdered using the same mo as a series of killings that hallstrom and ridgely are already investigating emma herself is in danger because shes the only person who can identify the killer hallstroms colleagues remain doubtful because emmas vision flawed when the killer begins to stalk emma hallstrom has her placed under police protection and the two soon become lovers while hallstrom tries to figure out who the killer is emma is a blind cellist who finally gets the opportunity to get to see meanwhile a string of bizzar rapes and murders has taken place all of the victims have had transplants within the last month a coincidence

the men bet him twenty dollars that he wont be able to seduce the woman the cocky man gets up and dances duckstyle in front of the female player who looks so lost in her music that she doesnt even realise hes there the cocky man grows wilder and wilder and he makes a full striptease in front of everybody trying to impress her reaching to the point when he shows her his ass to no avail another female patron caryn cheever of the bar gets excited and starts throwing money to the cocky man as though that were a strip nightclub and he were performing for her the camera lens approaches the fiddler player who is called emma brody madeleine stower and the audience can see that theres a kind of shroud over her blue eyes she is blind and thats why she didnt take any notice of the cocky man at allthe concert finishes and everybody is happy because the public had the best time of their lives her friend candice laurie metcalf congratulates the band while they are packing their things into their van especially emma who drove everybody wild but she says that her biggest fan is her dog ralphie louie on the underground train we can see ralphie on his harness as a leading dog a passenger kevin mathews pets ralphie on his head saying nice dogemma arrives to his flat in a bulding called flat iron building she knows that the clerk mr cuchetto mario tanzi is in the main lobby although he

colour somebody knocks at her door opens it but leaves without answering to her questions of who it wasdr pierce says that emma can see but that she isnt able to recognise what she sees quite well emma tells come in to candice but who enters is dr pierce when she describes her lady visitor dr pierce tells her that that was candice but that she brought the bunch of flowers the day before dr

time during emmas hospital stay there a reporter lia d mortensen interviews her emma asks the reporter if she is pretty and she answers that her boyfriend tells her she is emma seems to have low

valerie wheaton joy gregory of her appears and tells her that she has slid a letter for her which got delievered to her home emma does the rest of the climbing up on her ownback home ralphie stares at emmas drunk behaviour she throws a glass to her reflection and a slipper to the tv set emma goes to the door and sees a shadow which she thinks it must be the clerk somebody whispers emma its alright and leavesthe following morning emma wakes up in half a stupor she sees that the door to her apartment is open and goes to close it when she sees a dangerous staring at her she feels surprised and turns around seeing the man staring back at her in her apartment she leaves out a soft cry but immediately she only sees the blurry images of the courtains and ralphie barking at her emma bangs on valeries door but nor she neither mr cuchetto open up their doors emma heads for the main door of her building even the face of an old bump les podewell looks scarythe police station is noisy and nobody has the time to sit and talk to her ordeal so she decides to talk to detective john hallstrom aidan quinn who is munching on a doghnout aidan seems to be laughing at her so she gets impatient and asks if cops do something or just sit around and drink coffee john asks her if she drank something last night and when she admits that she had drunk a lot of wine he gets rid of her because she couldnt read a funny poster saying detectives do it under cover she says she asked for him because of his voice leuetenant mitchell brudce a young arrives and tells john to clean up his office space but john leaves the task to thomas ridgely james remar who was the cop which didnt have the time to listen to emma firston her following revision emma complains to pierce that she feels like an idiot and that she looks like her mother pierce tells her that she is prettythe bloody body of valerie wheaton appears on her bathtub she was raped and strangled the forensic doctor darryl rocky davis feels disgusted at johns humour questioning the dead boty about what happened john knocks at emmas door and they recognise each other immediately valerie used to have a lover whom she would call baby the man who said emma its alright was not mr cachutto as he had a different voice the conversation ends with emma asking him if he likes roses because she can smell the scent all the interrogation takes place at the light of some candles so that emmas eyes cant hurt herjohn talks to mitchell now that he has started to believe her when emma returns to her apartment a cop opens the door for her at the

case and emmathe dovers  with emma  play at the metro a huge venue which stays sold out emma has trouble playing because the images she sees confuse her but tries to concentrate at one point she thinks she sees the man at her doorstep among the audience she stops playing and tells candice to call hallstrom she tries to identify the attacant among a series of suspects at first she thinks she has identified number 4 but then her sight clears and the man ed clay is nothing like the man she sawhallstrom is angry because she had said that her sight was better he asks about her mother but she refuses to comment on that they have a conversation while having some coffee soon afterwards pierce can testify that emma can now see and read while walking down a corridor emma thinks she can recognise a man there but then there is nobody in the corridor emma leaves the hospital with ralphie ralph acts weirdly stopping pulling from emma backwards and then running to a small pool of may be blood ralph barks maybe at the underground train maybe at a man who is in the parking lot ralph runs after him barking but the man runs away and another car drives over poor ralphie she tells the cops that ralph could smell the man ralph is badlyhurt but alivenow its mitchell who thinks that emma is a deadend for the case john emphasizes that she saw him so he visits her afterwards even a small lamp can hurt her eyes and she admits that she saw valerie and her father after they were dead emma goes mad and breaks every lightbulb to pieces john pushes her against the wall and it looks like there is some attraction between themthe parade of saint patricks day a cop kevin d swerdlow mentions to john that she plays the violin he goers to listen to her at a bar and somehow looks enraptured
