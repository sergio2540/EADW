robert searle an american nuclear submarine encounters an alien species which coincidentally causes massive electrical and hydraulic malfunctions causing the sub to crash into an underwater cliff and sink the navy asks the workers of a nearby underwater oil rig who are joined by a number of navy seals to locate and investigate the cause of the crash as the crew embark on their mission they encounter a number of difficulties and discover that they may not be alone there is something else down there when an american nuclear submarine crashes the united states government believe the russians to be responsible they enlist the help of a team of underwater drilling platform workers who are to help the deployed navy seals locate the crash site as they get closer to their destination the friction between the two teams increases when some workers report seeing ufos underwater the seals grow increasingly suspicious and suspect a russian minisub after a series of nearfatal disasters the workers find that they are the only people who are capable of stopping world war iii but they are not the only inhabitants of the deep and strange things are happening back at the surface when the crew of an underwater oil rig are enlisted to assist in the rescue of an american nuclear submarine at the height of the cold war they discover a strange and mysterious force living in the deep and their rescue mission becomes an adventure into the wondrous and the unknown during the height of the cold war the uss montana a us nuclear ballistic submarine sinks into an ocean abyss due to unknown circumstances the us navy scramble to the scene to rescue survivors and recover the nuclear missles on board before nearby russian forces do their best hope are a team of divers attached to a submersible drilling platform not far from the crash site during the operation freak weather conditions damage the platform and sever its communication with the surface as world war iii looms above and tensions rise between the divers and a deployed seal team the rescuers discover that there is something else besides the submarine in the abyss the ballistic missile submarine uss montana sinks under mysterious circumstances the doomed boat settles on a ledge several hundred feet deep and on the edge of an even deeper ocean abyss us navy seals are brought in to salvage the subs missiles and an experimental civilian deep water oildrilling rig is commandeered to help all goes well until the seal leader suffers from high pressure madness and the rig is visited by the nonterrestrial intelligence that apparently lives in the abyss the ensuing struggle results in a race against time to prevent world war iii and a reunion between the estranged couple that designed and operate the oil rig text appearing in red describes footage from the 1993 special edition of the filmthe montana a us navy nuclear missile submarine operating deep in the cayman trough in the caribbean sea encounters an unidentified submerged object the object passes very close to the submarine and the vessel loses power power is restored after a few moments however the sub has drifted too close to the underwater canyon wall and collides with it causing catastrophic damage an officer is able to launch the subs emergency beacon before the sub floods drowning the entire crewas soviet ships and submarines head towards the area in an attempt to salvage the sub and with a hurricane moving in the americans decide that the quickest way to mount a rescue is for a us navy seal team to be inserted onto a privately owned experimental underwater oil drilling platform which they will then use as their base of operations the platforms designer and chief engineer dr lindsey brigman mary elizabeth mastrantonio is furious at the notion of her rig being commandeered for the mission her estranged husband virgil bud brigman ed harris is the foreman of the platform however benthic petroleum the rigs financier has already agreed to cooperate with the navy and has promised the rigs crew substantial bonus pay lindsey herself travels down to the rig with the seal team to oversee the operation personally after eight hours in a compression chamber lindsey and the seal team emerge no one however sees that seal leader lt hiram coffey michael biehn has developed high pressure nervous syndrome hpns when he has a slight hand tremor lindsey and bud promptly begin arguing with each other revealing that they are a separated married couple bud becomes furious and throws his wedding band into a toilet he relents after a few moments and fishes it out staining his hand with the toilets sanitation fluidthe rig and seal teams prepare to investigate the submarine wreck one of the seals shows crew members hippy todd graff and catfish leo burmester a hightech underwater breathing system that uses oxygenated fluid instead of air the system allows its wearer to survive at extreme ocean depths without succumbing to the immense water pressure coffey himself leads the entire operation issuing orders and angrily reprimanding the crew when they begin joking with each otherwhile searching the sub for survivors the collective team encounters strange creatures they cant identify the same beings that inadvertently caused the submarine to sink lindsey piloting one of the rigs three minisubs experiences the same type of power loss that the montana did while searching a compartment on the montana buds partner jammer john bedford lloyd the rig crews biggest member sees a strange glowing creature and panics when he tries to escape the chamber he damages the valve on his breathing apparatus and begins to convulse bud and his comrades are able to save jammer but the incident puts him in a comaas the storm intensifies coffey and his team take one of the rigs minisubs without authorization on a classified mission to the montana to retrieve one of the warheads from the ships trident missiles unbeknownst to the seal team the minisub that they took was the only vehicle capable of disconnecting the stations umbilical cord to its parent surface ship the benthic explorer upon their return the seals remove the warhead and turn the sub over to its normal pilot one night kimberly scott who takes it out in an attempt to disconnect the umbilicusby this time the explorer is in the middle of the hurricane and being tossed violently by powerful winds and waves generated by the storm the ships motion makes it impossible for one night to disconnect the cable which is jerking about with such power that it begins to drag the station along the bottom towards the trench the stress of the cable causes the derrick crane that supports the station to break away from the ship momentarily stopping the stations slide towards the trench the crew is relieved that they have avoided death but the joy is shortlived as they realize the crane which is still attached to the rig via the umbilicus is descending to them at an increasing rate as it floats past the rig into the chasm the crew realizes that the cranes momentum will pull the rig into the chasm and they brace for the impact the impact violently jerks the station towards the chasm causing massive damage and flooding killing six of the stations crew and injuring several of the surviving crew and seals the rig is not pulled into the trench stopping a few feet short of the precipicetensions mount as the platform has lost contact with the surface and anger of the crew towards the seals intensifies over the deaths of their friends and coworkers the crew begins to experience more strange encounters from what appear to be underwater beings referred to as nonterrestrial intelligences or ntis which the paranoid coffey determines to be a threat one such incident involves an encounter with a tentacle that appears to be made entirely of water but can move like a snake it also morphs into the faces of both lindsey and budd in an apparent attempt to communicate when coffey finds the tentacles origin in the rigs diving pool he panics and closes one of the hatches cutting it off and the remainder sinks into the depths when the end of the tentacle looks at him coffey becomes even more scared and paranoidstrapping the warhead to big geek one of the platforms remote operated vehicles he decides to send both of them down to the bottom of the trench where the ntis appear to be coming from bud and lindsey intervene bud ties the rov to a railing on the rig and is picked up by lindsey piloting one of the rigs subs after a furious chase along the sea bottom lindsey disables both subs and stops coffey who falls off a ledge and is crushed within his submersible by the pressure however they cannot stop the rov from taking the warhead down into the trench trapped in their rapidlyflooding sub lindsey orders bud to use the ships sole diving suit to swim back to the platform towing her body while she will drown she banks on the very cold water preserving her via the mammalian diving reflex until she can be resuscitated in the platform a very tense situation develops while her comrades try to resuscitate her when using emergency equipment fails but frantically begins to shake and even slap lindsey who regains consciousness much to the relief of the entire crewbud then dons an experimental diving suit given to him by the remaining seals in which the diver breathes an oxygenated fluid instead of air this has the advantage of allowing the diver to descend to incredible depths without injury as the body will not be crushed by the pressure by having liquid in the lungs rather than gas buds mission is to dive to the bottom of the trench two miles down and deeper than anyone has ever gone before and disarm the warhead before it detonates he succeeds in his mission but lindsey is distressed to learn that he does not have enough breathing fluid remaining to allow his return to the platform he tells her via a wrist keypad that he always knew it was a oneway trip but that he had to go to save both the platform crew and the ntis he transmits a final message saying that he loves her and still considers her to be his wife and she tells him how much she loves him before assuming hes deadthe ntis find bud as his oxygen runs out and bring him onto their ship they provide him with air to breathe at his normal pressure and engage in silent communication with him they then show him several television clips they have stored of humanitys destructive behavior silently explaining that they have left humans alone but now believe humans are too selfdestructive to continue this behavior as a result the ntis are using their ability to control water to form 1000 high tsunamis off the coasts of every continent on earth threatening to destroy humanity the ntis view buds transmission love you wife and decide to stop the storm and tsunamis realizing humans do possess compassion for each other with everyone baffled bud types another message into his communicator and tells them what he has discovered the ntis proceed to surface their underwater ship but it is so massive it lifts most of the naval fleet patrolling the area above the water including the explorer everyone seems fine including the underwater crew without any need to decompress as the ntis altered their bodies to allow this lindsey sees bud emerge from the nti ship and they rush to each other greeting each other as a newlywed couple would they engage in a passionate kiss 7.6submarine underwater abyss alien ocean estranged-couple
