distracted to talk to elaine when she tries to attract his attention he loves his aunts and does not want the police involved so he determines that teddy known to be a lunatic should take the blame if the murders ever come to light he thus has to immediately commit teddy to happydale commitment requires that papers be signed by judge cullman vaughan glaser dr gilchrist chester clute and teddy as mortimer tries to contact happydale a mr gibbs edward mcwade arrives to look for a room to rent he is almost poisoned by the aunts but mortimer snatches the wine away just in time much to the aunts

and then rushes out to see judge cullman admonishing the aunts to let noone into the house before he returns however when mortimers brother jonathan and his companion plastic surgeon dr einstein peter lorre arrive the aunts cant prevent them from entering jonathan looks like boris karloff as a result of dr einsteins work and so is not immediately recognized by the aunts but he convinces them of his identity by remembering details of family history jonathan needs another new face as the police are after him for the murder of one mr spinalzo whose corpse is in jonathans carmortimer manages to get judge cullman to sign the papers at the house teddy shows dr einstein the panama canal where einstein spots the useful unfilled grave while jonathan intimidates his aunts into letting him and dr einstein stay jonathan decides to move the car round to the side of the house so he can bring mr spinalzos corpse in surreptitiously simultaneously the aunts instruct teddy to move the corpse of mr hoskins from the window seat down to the cellar jonathan dr einstein and the aunts then go to bed all intending to be active later jonathan and dr einstein to move mr spinalzo the aunts to hold funeral services for mr hoskins as soon as the house is dark teddy moves mr hoskins down to the cellar and then jonathan passes mr spinalzo through the window to dr einstein who manages to hide the corpse in the window seat before elaine knocks and enters she reacts when she learns who jonathan is he suspicious she has seen him with the corpse and the car tries to shut her in the cellar the aunts now dressed in mourning are roused and mortimer returns he promptly quarrels with jonathan and once again neglects elaine who storms out as he calls mr witherspoonmortimer looks again in the window seat to find a new corpse ye gods theres another one aunt abby confronted reacts indignantly to mortimers suggestion that this is one of her victims and fetches aunt martha to look when mortimer and jonathan both try to stop her mortimer realizes that jonathan is responsible for this latest body mortimer offers jonathan a chance to leave and take the evidence with him and then officer ohara arrives wanting to tell mortimer about a play hes writing mortimer gives jonathan an ultimatum to leave jonathan decides not to and dr einstein discovers mr hoskins body in the cellar which they think is mortimers work mortimer however wishes to cut no deal with jonathan and rushes out to get the signature of dr gilchrist for teddys commitment papersaunt abby and aunt martha come in and to jonathans surprise admit responsibility for mr hoskins and their other victims it turns out the aunts and jonathan have each committed twelve murders which dr einstein finds hilarious  he and jonathan have traveled the world to achieve what the aunts have done staying at home in brooklyn as the aunts go down to hold services for mr hoskins jonathan decides he needs one more victim  who will be his hated brother mortimer he moves mr spinalzo to panama and buries him with mr hoskins much to the aunts indignation mortimer brings dr gilchrist to the graveyard and brings teddy out to meet him teddy greets gilchrist as dr livingstone  he presumes mortimer then sees elaine and tells her their marriage must be called off as insanity runs in my family  it practically gallops dr gilchrist having just been appointed ambassador to bolivia by teddy signs the papers for his commitment jonathan plots mortimers murder with dr einstein by the melbourne method  two hours of torturemortimer persuades teddy to sign the committal papers dr einstein tries to convince mortimer to flee but mortimer is not listening in a discussion about the idiocy of victims in plays he allows himself to be overpowered gagged and tied up jonathan prepares to set to work on the melbourne method dr einstein distraught needs a drink and seizes the decanter of poisoned wine pouring himself and jonathan each a glass as they are about to drink teddy startles them by blowing his bugle and they drop their glasses jonathan realizing the neighborhood will be roused decides on murder the quick way but officer ohara arrives and sees mortimer tied up dr einstein persuades him that mortimer is enacting a scene from a play ohara refuses to untie mortimer and instead with a captive audience recounts the plot of the play he is writing jonathan tries to kill ohara but is knocked out by dr einstein using a shoe sergeant brophy and another policeman officer saunders john ridgely arrive and telephone back to the station calling off the big manhunt the manhunt is for ohara who has not called in but jonathan believes theyre talking about him and gives himself up then he reacts violently to the suggestion that he looks like boris karloffin the resulting fight mortimer frees himself lieutenant rooney james gleason arrives and recognizes jonathan as an escapee from the indiana prison for the criminally insane teddys president roosevelt act confuses the lieutenant but mortimer assures him that teddy is due to go to happydale and that teddys tales of thirteen bodies in the cellar are part of his delusion however teddy has to be persuaded to resign the commitment papers as teddy brewster rather than teddy roosevelt mr witherspoon arrives to collect teddy to go on his hunting trip to africa elaine sneaks into the house through the cellaraunt abby and aunt martha distraught about being separated from teddy want to commit themselves to happydale too mr witherspoon is reluctant as he thinks they are sane but when they also start talking about the thirteen bodies in the cellar he agrees needing a doctors signature they rope in dr einstein einstein then escapes even though his wanted description is telephoned through in his hearing and that of the lieutenant mortimer signs as next of kin which worries the aunts they reveal that he is in fact not a brewster his father was a chef on a tramp steamer and his mother was a cook whom the aunts brother married mortimer is delighted im the son of a seacook that he isnt a biological member of the homicidally insane brewster family and so can marry elaine without fear that he will go mad and breed mad children elaine emerges from the cellar having discovered the graves and has to be kissed by an ecstatic mortimer into forgetting this the movie ends as he picks her up and runs away much to the amazement of the taxicab driver garry owen who has been waiting for them throughout 8.1cellar critic insanity poison
