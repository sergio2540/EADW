thats no ordinary numbskull thats lt frank drebin crashing the ceremonies to stop a terrorist plot that could mean curtains for him  or will a simple window shade be enough frank drebin is persuaded out of retirement to go undercover in a state prison there he is to find out what top terrorist rocco has planned for when he escapes franks wife jane is desperate for a baby this adds to franks problems a host of celebrities at the academy awards ceremony are humiliated by frank as he blunders his way trying to foil rocco frank drebin nielsen has retired from police work and lives a basically happy life with his wife jane presley it remains basically happy because police work has been franks meaning of life and he feels unhappy about not being able to legally take on criminals anymore additionally jane tries to push him into siring a child but frank does not have the courage to go through this yetit comes as a blessing to him when his old friends ed hocken kennedy and

after winning his trust the two stage their breakout together rocco even manages to persuade his dominant and highly distrustful mother muriel freeman to take frank into their house however both are loth to tell frank too many details right away which is why he is forced to stay around a little longer in the meantime jane joins her friend louise on a wild road trip but in time she realizes that she really misses frank when she returns and finds him missing she follows a clue frank had inadvertently left behind to tanya where she is promptly taken hostage by rocco and his mother frank is
