of some icbms the americans mobilize among the vessels sent is the nuclear sub the alabama but before they leave they need a new xo and among the choices is commander hunter who hasnt seen much action but the ships captain ramsey oks him while on the way there was an incident and hunter disagreed with how ramsey handled it its evident that ramsey doesnt think much of hunter because hunter was college educated while ramsey worked his way up theyre given orders to attack but when they were in the process of receiving another order the ships communications were damaged so the entire message was not received ramsey decides to continue with their previous order while hunter wants to reestablish contact first thats when the two men butt heads that ends with hunter relieving ramsey later when some men die some of the officers feel that hunter is not up to the task so they team up to retake control but hunter has taken precautions instability in russia results in the deployment of the the nuclear submarine alabama russian rebels have taken over a nuclear missile site and are fueling them for a possible strike against the usa tensions run high undersea when the launch message is received followed by an incomplete followup could the followup message have been to cancel the earlier orders as the russian civil war gradually gets worse the us navy gets activated fearing a nuclear fallout upstart commander hunter and veteran captain ramsey along with several other naval officers aboard a nuclear missile submarine to avert the attack on the united states but due to some misunderstanding hunter and ramsey begin to quarrel for command of the submarine in the near future russian rebels have taken over one of the icbm bases in the ussr alarmed by the prospect of a rebel strike the us sends the uss alabama a nuclear ballistic submarine to watch over the base and retaliate in case they launch while on patrol the submarine is attacked and the radio systems are knocked out but after first receiving an emergency message from hq to launch nuclear missiles at the rebels a second emergency message received during the battle is only partially recovered captain ramsey decides to carry out the first order to launch the missiles regardless while xo hunter wants to wait for a successful receipt of the second message once the radio systems are repaired the conflict escalates into mutiny as ramsey and hunter fight for control of the alabamas nuclear missiles the story opens with reports of a rebel force taking over nuclear missile launch sites near vladivostok in eastern russia the leader of the force a radical russian named radchenko threatens to launch the missiles he has seized radchenko has also seized control of three akulaclass attack submarines to protect the shores off vladivostokthe government of the united states decides to send its bestequipped nuclear submarine the alabama into patrol off the coast of vladivostok if necessary the alabama will become a first strike launching platform for nuclear missiles to stop radchenkos attempts to launch his own missilescommander ron hunter of the us navy is called into an interview with the alabamas captain ramsey ramseys own executive officer xo is ill and a replacement is needed ramsey is impressed with hunters service record and the two connect over horse riding ramseys jack russell terrier also seems to approve of hunterthe situation in vladivostok escalates and hunter and his friend lt weps ince are called up for duty and leave immediately for the alabama ramsey gives a stirring sendoff speech and the boat puts to sea before they submerge ramsey and hunter enjoy cigarsat an officers dinner ramsey and the crew pontificate about the threat of nuclear war ramsey is eager to know hunters views on the subject especially since the xo has a degree in philosophy hunter states the the true nature of war is to serve itself and leave the world destroyed ramsey takes the opinion seriously although he seems to disagree with his xoon patrol off the eastern coast of russia the alabama runs drills when a fire breaks out in the galley hunter rushes to help put the blaze out at that moment ramsey orders a missile launching drill to be performed hunter is perturbed that ramsey would order a drill in the midst of an emergency but reports to the bridge to oversee the transfer of coded transmissions and report to ramsey during a lull in the drill hunter informs the captain that the fire in the galley could flare up again but ramsey dismisses him concentrating on the drill a report comes in from below decks one of the crew has suffered a heart attack ramsey cancels the drill and goes below to check on the crew member who has diedramsey orders hunter into his cabin and reprimands him for trying to interrupt the drill hunter calmly counters that the fire needed more attention and that the captains calling for a drill had jeopardized the safety of the boat ramsey tells the xo that confusion aboard a submarine is something to be taken advantage of hunter still obviously disagrees however he chooses not to say sothe alabama receives an emergency action message eam informing them that radchenko is very close to breaking the codes for missile launch and that the us defense condition defcon has been raised to 3 further patrols with the alabamas crew on even higher alert will be necessary a fight breaks out between a petty officer rivetti and another man bennefield over the origins of the silver surfer and hunter breaks it up telling rivetti to act like a leader hunter reports to ramsey about the altercation and the tension amongst the crew over the their current state of readiness ramsey announces to the crew over the boats pa system that infighting will not be tolerated and the threat of war is of the utmost importancein the subs sonar cabin rivetti and his unit detect an enemy submarine possibly one of the akulas that radchenko has command of ramsey orders him to identify the sub and orders an evasion maneuver to escape detection by the akula an eam arrives seemingly ordering a launch of the alabamas missiles ramsey orders the procedures for launch to be initiated another eam comes in but the alabama is too deep to receive it hunter requests that the subs buoy be launched to receive the eam the buoy winch fails causing noise and alerting the akula to the alabamas location the akula attacks with torpedoes the alabama successfully evades the torpedoes one of which explodes very close severing the buoy cable the alabama suffers minor damage the akula disappears from sonar and the buoy cable is severed cutting off the eam additionally the radio equipment has suffered severe damage and no messages are going out or coming inramsey and hunter review the eam finding that the message doesnt contain any clear order hunter recommends that the alabama surface to receive the rest of the message but ramsey refuses saying its too dangerous with the akula still nearby ramsey intends to continue with the launch of his missiles but hunter quickly disagrees saying the incomplete message could be a target package change or an order to cancel the launch ramsey counters saying that the message is not a complete order and not to be followed up upon and orders hunter to repeat his command to launch hunter refuses under navy regulations citing the fact that ramseys order must be repeated for it to stand concluding that the captain is acting irrationally when ramsey will not concur with hunter the xo orders ramsey to be arrested and locked in his cabin a hesitant chief of the boat concurs with the xo and has the captain detained hunter assumes command and informs the crew that they will still patrol at the same state of readiness and attempt to reestablish communications to verify the eamon sonar the akula reappears and attacks launching torpedoes hunter orders an evasion plan and the alabama avoids being hit hunter launches two more torpedoes which connect with their target and destroy the akula however a last torpedo was launched by the akula before it was destroyed and explodes very close to the alabama propulsion is damaged and the bilge bay takes on water despite the efforts of several crew members to contain it the men in the bilge bay drown when hunter orders the bilge bay sealed meanwhile the alabama is sinking rapidly approaching a depth of 1850 feet where the intense water pressure will crush the hull propulsion is restored before the boat can be destroyed and the boat rises to a safe depthseveral of ramseys officers decide that hunter is unfit for command and they plot a countermutiny to free ramsey they persuade weps to join them and give them the key to the weapons locker to take the sub back by force they free ramsey who follows the armed men back to the bridge where they arrest hunter and the other officers who aided him in the mutiny ramsey assumes command and order the launch to continue while in detention hunter talks philosophically about the choice to launch nuclear missiles and start the destruction of the worldrivetti while walking between cabins is stopped by the same man he fought with earlier rivetti is able to overpower the larger man and free hunter and the other arrested officers they make their way back to the bridge to stop ramsey from launching after a tense altercation in the weapons cabin which delays ramsey long enough for hunter to seize the master missile key the two face off on the bridge ramsey hits hunter in the face twice demanding his missile key back communications reports that the radio is very close to being operational ramsey allows three minutes for the radio to operate again and receive another eam the two sit in the command center awaiting the message while they do ramsey lights a cigar and brings up the subject of horse riding again saying that lipizzaner stallions are from portugal hunter tells the captain theyre spanish horses born with a black color and turn white later in life ramsey still insists theyre from portugalrivetti reports that the eam transmitter is fixed and that a new eam is coming in its brought to the bridge and authenticated when authenticated the message is for the alabama to stand down and cancel the launch of their missiles ramsey retires himself from the bridge and is saluted as he walks to his cabinin pearl harbor hawaii a general inquiry is called before the pacific fleet admiral having reviewed the incident he tells both hunter and ramsey that they both were right and wrong in their actions aboard the alabama off the record he admonishes both of them saying theyve done much to disrupt the traditional chain of command of the navy the admiral also announces to hunters surprise that ramsey has filed for retirement hunter is further astonished when he hears that he is to be given a captains commission aboard another submarine and that he came highly recommended by ramsey himselfoutside navy hq ramsey is retrieving his dog from an ensign he sees hunter and tells him that he was right about the lipizzaner stallions being from spain the two
