the hysterical major attempting to call for help but gets blocked on the other end of the line by the bureaucratic podpeople at first he suspects martis father of being a podman but when he realizes he isnt he explains while wolfing down sleepprevention pills that it is too late for running all they can do is fight their conversation is interrupted by the arrival of the fearsome podpeople led by the base commander martis father hides instead of shooting all of the podpeople with his gun the major allows them to try to convince him that the individual is never important and that only mindlessness and heartlessness can solve problems he shoots himself rather than live in such a worldmartis father returns to marti and andy and asks them to follow him claiming to have found a way out they drive aimlessly through the military base as loudspeakers shout out instructions for spreading the invasion by carrying out pods in trucks frightened by all this marti asks her father where exactly theyre going he never gives her a straight answer instead replying i know what im doing dont worryi know exactly what im doing realizing that her father was podded while he was away she swerves the car to the side and tries to escape with her brother but her father tries to keep her in the van adding to all this is the helicopter pilot tim young who still hasnt figured out what has been going on stepping onto the scene and marti takes his gun and shoots her podfather dead the pilot is horrified to see him shrink into a mass of seething and bloody goomarti tim and andy hide out in a nearby hanger where tim tells them that its too dangerous to be spotted in the open so hell go alone as soon as he goes in he is approached by the podpeople and pretends to be a podman and although the podpeople suspect strongly that hes a human they cant find any evidence and let him go while hes starting up the helicopter several of the podpeople approach marti and andy tim sees this from the air and follows them to a building on the base where humans are being duplicated tim lands the helicopter and enters the building to look for marti and finds her nearly taken over by her pod
