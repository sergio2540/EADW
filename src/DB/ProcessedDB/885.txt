hopefully an opportunity for lisa to sort out what she wants to do with her lifethe town is very quiet indeed on this late fall afternoon its the offseason for tourists but they also see none of the 400 yearround residents they drive up to jennys residenceoffice hoping that hilda judith drake jennys housekeeper has made good on her promise of apple pie for dinner instead they find her dead in the kitchen a terrible look of fear on her face every inch of visible skin bruised and blackened the phone is also dead and noises upstairs indicate an intruder might still be present so they decide to go quickly to the deputy sheriffs officeoddly jennys jeep wont start neither it seems will any other vehicle in town nightfall is coming on so they continue to the deputys office on foot deputy henderson larry odien is also dead his body looking like hildas but there is another mystery here he had drawn his gun and fired multiple rounds yet there is no sign of another body or blood jenny gets a shotgun from the deputys gun rack and they head for the bakery if theyre likely to find anyone she tells lisa it will be there the owners jacob and anna also live in the rooms above the bakery the front door is locked they hear sounds and see shadows that suggest they are being followed they run down the alley and go in through the back door they are greeted by the grisly sight of two severed hands lying on a workbench still grasping a rolling pin the timer on the oven goes off jenny opens it warily there are only some cake layers baking they are momentarily relieveduntil jacobs and annas severed heads fall down onto the cakeshuddled together they move toward the front of the bakery night has fallen and its very dark the phone rings jenny answers but there is no human voice on the line just an eerie muttering whisper they turn to leave again and are stopped by three men holding flashlights and guns deputy henderson had been on the phone with headquarters when the line went dead sheriff bryce hammond ben affleck and two deputies steve shanning nicky katt and stuart stu wargle liev shreiber have come to investigatethey decide to return to the deputys office but as they step outside the bakery every horn siren whistle and bell in snowfield suddenly goes off the noise is deafening for a full minute then just as suddenly as it began it all stops and the only lights left on are at the candleglow inn up the street it seems theyre expected there next a glance at the guest book in the lobby shows there are only four guests faint music starts to play upstairs patsy cline singing i fall to pieces sheriff bryce and deputy stu go up to check the rooms the women follow at a little distance with deputy stevesheriff bryce enters one room and finds it empty he opens a closet door and is confronted with a vision flashback of a young boy luke eberl aiming a gun at him it disappears almost immediately but bryce is very shaken by it deputy stu enters another room and finds the body of a young woman on the bed she has the bruised look of the housekeeper and deputy but she is also attractive and shapely stu sits on the bed next to her you wanna tell me what happened here he murmurs and then snickers oddly he puts a hand on her leg on the bare skin below the hem of her skirt just as sheriff bryce walks in what are you doing stu he asks stu jumps up startled embarrassed at a loss to explain looking for clues the sheriff suggests sarcastically stu says yes but both men know what was going on bryce decides to let it go watch the hall stu he says and leaves when hes out of sight stu laughs again his strange wheezing snicker and with a last glance back at the dead girl follows bryce into the hall hey he says to lisa leering down at her you wanna see somethin she looks at him with disgust and says no emphaticallybryce has found the room where the music was playing on the bedside radio he switches it off and asks jenny to come in he shows her the bathroom it was locked from inside hed had to break in but no one is there now and there are no other doors or windows someone has written on the mirror in lipstick dr timothy flyte  the ancient enemy he asks jenny if shes ever heard of timothy flyte she tells him no hes not a localfrom another empty room they all hear a sound like metal chains being dropped they enter cautiously and find a large pile of metallic objects lying on top of the bed jewelry buttons watches gold teeth and more whoever it is he strips them to the skin says deputy steve beyond the skin says dr jenny in an odd tone as they all look at her she picks a flat metallic disk out of the pile its a pacemaker she tells themthey go back to the lobby to discuss the situation they hear the music start upstairs patsy cline again a woman suddenly screams outside helphelp me deputy steve shouts cover me bryce and runs out with his gun drawn bryce calls for him to wait and follows but its too late they hear him scream and when they get outside all thats left are his empty shoes and his gun spinning on the pavementthey go back to deputy hendersons office they zip the deputy into a body bag and store him in the basement bryce tries to radio for help he tells the deputy on the other end of the transmission about dr timothy flyte and asks them to send help from the local military installation but the transmission is garbled and broken and finally collapses they are not sure how muchor if anyof it was heardbryce and stu load as many weapons and lay out as much ammunition as possible preparing for a siege the lights go out they all hear something at the window and see a huge almost mansized moth the two men fire at it again and again until it goes away after a moment stu walks over to look out the ruined window the creature flies in again grabs him by the face slams him against the opposite wall and flings him down it flies around the room a few moments longer threatening to grab each of the remaining three humans in turn while bryce shoots at it over and over without effect at last it flies out the windowdeputy wargle is dead his face and his brain incredibly were completely consumed in the few moments the creature had hold of him they zip him into a body bag of his own and take him to the basement to keep company with henderson they settle down to wait for morning if thats possibleat the editorial offices of wide world news in new york city dr timothy flyte peter otoole is working late formerly a distinguished member of the faculty at oxford university he has been reduced to writing articles for this sleazy tabloid because the subject of his research is considered fanciful and ridiculous he is approached by two men robert knepper bo hopkins from the fbi they ask him to go with them as a matter of national securityin snowfield while lisa is trying to nap in a jail cell dr jenny and sheriff bryce are in the next room talking it turns out he is a former fbi agent too who came to be sheriff in this rural county because of an incident that occurred in a raid on a drug house during his former career hed opened a closet door to find a child pointing a gun at him had shot and killed the child only to find out afterward the gun was just a toy hed been cleared of any blame but had been unable to overcome his guilt he still carries a newspaper clipping of the event the boys picture is in the article we see he is the phantom bryce glimpsed earlier in the closet at the hotellisa interrupts their conversation to ask for an escort to the restroom bryce checks inside finds it clear and leaves her there alone she is standing at one of the sinks getting a cigarette out of her bag when an odd squealing sound wafts up out of the drain she almost convinces herself that its nothing until a toilet in one of the three empty stalls behind her flushes she goes to inspect them finds nothingand as she is closing the last door finds deputy stu behind it leering at her you wanna see somethin he asks she runs out screaming bryce goes in to investigate and finds nothing they check the body bags in the basement theyre both empty they begin to speculate could it be moving through the town through the sewers and drainsdr flyte is en route to snowfield with general leland copperfield clayton powell as part of a large specialized response team scientists and military personnel a couple of large sophisticated mobile labs and an armored strike vehicle prepared to deal with whatever threat they may find general copperfield asks dr flyte to tell him about his theory of the ancient enemy dr flyte explains that throughout history there have been incidents of unexplained mass disappearances he cites the abandoned mayan cities of copan piedras negras and palenque the lost colony at roanoke the army that vanished outside nanking china in 1939 he postulates that an undiscovered entity that exists deep in the earth is responsible for these incidents and if not stopped it could eventually cause the extinction of the human racethey arrive in snowfield and bryce jenny and lisa come to meet them the first thing we need to know says general copperfield is what kind of threat were dealing with chemical biological or other at the moment replies bryce ruefully im kind of leaning toward other the team spreads out and the scientists begin gathering data they encounter many weird and frightening sights including another pile of metallic objects in the church in front of the altar like an offering says one of the scientists dr flyte corrects him undigested remains he saysover the next few minutes in a stunning series of horrific events the whole contingent is wiped out leaving only dr flyte sheriff bryce jenny and lisa general copperfield is last to be killed a pair of oily black tentacles seeps up through the pavement penetrates his hazmat suit and smothers him dead but still standing he leans over and smacks the faceplate of his helmet against the pavement shattering it he slowly removes a large curved piece of the glass from his mouth regurgitates into it and puts it on the pavement in front of dr flyte the eerie voice that was heard on the phone now speaks clearly from his mouth my flesh it says and as it does so the liquid in the glass resolves itself into a small spotted gecko study it write the gospel but do not try to leave witnesses to the miracle message delivered the generals body topples over and an oily black substance oozes out of the suit leaving it collapsed and empty on the pavementthey take shelter in one of the mobile labs dr flyte begins to analyze the tissue sample theorizing they come to the conclusion that this entity has lived in the depths of the earth for eons growing to immense size and absorbing knowledge from its prey it can separate off parts of itself to send as drones warriors phantoms having them assume the shapes of anything or anyone it has absorbed even of people or monsters from their memories and dreams with these it has manipulated bryce jenny and lisa into bringing dr flyte here to be its prophet to write its gospel for it has come to think of itself as godor devil perhaps because this is what some of its terrified victims thought in their final extremity omnipotent immortal indestructibledr flytes analysis reveals that it is closely akin to oil in its chemical composition he tells the others that there is a manmade bacterium among the samples in the lab that was developed to break up and disperse oil spills ifthey can culture enough of it and ifthey can figure out a way to deliver it and ifthey can draw the whole mass of it to them long enough to infect it they might be able to destroy it bryce asks dr flyte if this will work and dr flyte says yes then adds unless theres a nucleus a small inner mass that can tear itself away from the core and survive on its own you know says bryce i really just wanted you to say yes therethe bacterium is cultured and loaded into glass vials to be launched by compressedair guns of the type used to shoot tranquilizers into large animals dr flyte steps outside walks up to an open manhole and calls to it he says that he must see itall of itin order to be able to write of it it remains silent hidden he says that he knows it has been wondering what theyre up to in the mobile lab he tells it that the others have been preparing a weapon to destroy it even after all theyve witnessed tonight they still dont believe youre a god they think youre just a thing an animal he waitsstill it doesnt appear his voice turns warm and inviting as he continues what they dont know is that death is for mortals not for gods show yourself gods have nothing to fear he waits a few moments longer then with just the right taunting note in his voice he adds or do theyit appears first as a single person standing silently opposite dr flyte an instant later all 400 residents of the town are standing there before him then all the people begin to merge and meld into one swirling mass which resolves itself into an immense hideous upright millipede bryce jenny and lisa run out of the mobile lab and fire their weapons into the it infected shouts dr flyte triumphantly it screams and begins to flail around violently jenny and lisa run for shelter into the nearby deputys office to reload their guns they are pursued by a drone of deputy stu they empty their shotguns into him knocking him down blowing away great chunks of his legs and arms they pause finally he is still for a moment as if dead then he begins to sing i fall to pieces tentacles shoot out of his arm and legstumps which he uses to drag himself toward them they flee up into the ceiling and he follows but he is ill infected by the bacteria and this makes him more angry and dangerous what did you do to me he bellows at the women jenny blows his head off with a shotgun incredibly a hand shoots out of the neck stump and reaches for lisa  jenny fires her last vial of the bacteria into the neck stump and at last he stops the deputy wargle drone dissolves into a revolting liquidthe greater mass of the entity is also breaking up like oil dropped into soapy water bryce follows the last of it down into the sewer he turns a corner and finds himself face to face with the boy he shot and killed during the drug raid he hesitates a tentacle shoots out of the boys mouth and knocks him literally for a loop the air gun is knocked in one direction and the extra bacteria viles are scattered on the ground in another before bryce can get to them the boy gathers them up he balances them in his hand with an insinuating smile bryce draws his handgun always this urge to shoot little boys says the drone mockingly no says bryce this time im going to miss he shoots the vials in the drones hand they explode spraying liquid all over him there is a moment of quiet then the drone begins to tremble and then to shake violently it cannot hold its shape any longer it shrieks and groans as it devolves with one final earshattering scream it is gone and bryce makes his way back to the othersas a helicopter arrives to rescue them dr flyte announces to the others that the entity has won after all it wanted him to tell the world and thats just what hes going to do the scene shifts to a quiet bar where an old cowboy lonnie chapman uncredited and a young cowgirl yvette nipar are watching dr flyte on the bars tv hes wrapping up the narrative of a documentary about the entity saying that a watch must be kept for it if it wasnt completely destroyed one day it may destroy mankinddo you believe that crap asks the old cowboy i dunno says the cowgirl stranger things have happened patty said that glen was abducted by aliens the cowboy scoffs glen wasnt abducted by aliens he run off to los angeles and if you was married to patty youd run off too a strange wheezing snicker is heard at the other end of the bar the other two look in that direction and the girl asks does that sound funny to you officerstu wargle stifles his laughter and swallows one of the peanuts hes been eating with his beer no maam he says with mock sincerity and then he adds slyly hey
