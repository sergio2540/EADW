american teenager of the eighties is accidentally sent back to 1955 in a plutoniumpowered delorean time machine invented by slightly mad scientist during his often hysterical always amazing trip back in time marty must make certain his teenage parentstobe meet and fall in love  so he can get back to the future marty mcfly is a teenager living in a small town who wishes to make it as a musician but unfortunately no one wants to give him a chance and his family is not the kind of family he or anyone could be proud of his brother has a crappy job his mother is a drunk his father doesnt have any guts especially when his biff tannen is around biff walks all over him but among of the bright spots in his life is his girlfriend jen and his friendship with emmett brown a crackpot scientist one night brown sends for marty to meet at an unusual time and its there that brown unveils to marty his invention a time machine which he built into a delorean brown reveals that due to the great amount of power needed for the time machine to works he tricked some libyans into giving him some plutonium brown had prepped it for its next run when the libyans show up and shoot him marty gets into the delorean and drives off and reaches the speed necessary to activate the time machine he finds himself in 1955 because that was the date brown last entered when he was showing marty how the machine works marty walks around and runs into his father and sees that even then biff tannen was walking all over him he follows him and gets struck by a car and finds himself being cared by his own mother marty then goes to see emmett brown and tries to tell him about his time machine so that he can help him get back to his own time when he convinces brown he shows brown the recording he made wherein he says how much power is needed to power the machine and thats when he tells marty that theres nothing they can do cause about the only thing that has enough power that is needed is a bolt of lightning and theyre difficult to predict that is until marty shows him a newspaper clipping that he brought with him that says that one week from now a bolt of lightning will hit the town clock tower that gives brown the inspiration to try and harness the power so that the time machine can be powered but brown remembers that when marty showed him his family photo it appears his siblings are disappearing thats when marty tells him about when he kept his father from being struck by a car when he was originally struck and would be nursed by the girl who would be his wife and martys mother but because of martys interference that didnt happened so it now appears his parents wont get together so marty has to try and get them together before he leaves it is the year 1985 marty mcfly a mildmannered high school student stopped by dr emmett l browns laboratory to play around with an amplifier then he receives a message from doc that he needs help from him for docs latest invention a time machine made out of a delorean sports car that can travel through time instantaneously when it reaches a speed velocity of 88 mph then doc was gunned down by libyan nationalists marty makes an effort to escape from the lybians by using the time machine then marty accidentally warps himself into 1955 where he meets both of his parents when they were teenagers then marty unintentionally interrupts his parents first meeting together he then finds a younger version of doc and together they try to find a way to get martys parentstobe back together and to get marty back to 1985 marty mcfly helps out his friend doc brown and ends up being taken back in time by docs timemachine marty a boy of the 80s has to come to grips with being in the 50s and get his parents to fall in love to set straight the damage his presence has done to the events of the past the year is 1985 and marty mcfly is your everyday teenager except for one problem he is stuck in 1955 after his good friend doc emmett brown is gunned down marty ends up sending the delorean back thirty years into the past now he must find the doc and convince him that he is from the future in order for the doc to send him back to the future but this is the least of martys problem after accidentally getting in the way of the important meeting between his future mother and father marty must get them back together before he changes time forever and destroys his own existence in the life of marty mcfly all is not well his family is dysfunctional his school punctuality is questionable and the music he likes and plays is just too darn loud his one true light is his girlfriend jenny and his one true friend is the somewhat offkilter doctor emmett brown in a request from doctor brown marty meets the mad scientist and discovers that his friend has built a time machine out of a delorean from there martys humdrum life becomes literally a blast from the past as he is transported to 1955 a stranger in a strange yet familiar land marty must seek out doctor brown to help send him back to his own time while simultaneously ensuring that his parents meet and fall in love the title logo appears on a black background the scene opens in dr emmett browns christopher lloyd garagehome laboratory as the camera pan over a large collection of clocks a robotic tin can opener opens a tin of spoiled dog food and empties the

theft of a case of plutoniumthe front door of the garage opens and marty mcfly michael j fox comes in marty calls out then reaches down to partly lift up the doormat he places a set of keys under the doormat then drops it back down marty enters the garage calling out for doc and whistling for einstein he comments on the mess the place is inmarty puts down his skateboard and it rolls along the floor until it hits a box of plutonium he turns on docs amplifier system turning all the settings to maximum a hum grows louder in the background marty plugs his electric guitar into a huge amplifier pauses and then plucks a string the amplifier blows up the impact throwing marty back against a bookshelf which falls causing the books and papers on it to fall off and land on his head marty lifts up his sunglasses and we finally get to see his whole facewhoa rock and roll he says when a loud ringing fills the garage it sounds like a fire alarm but then turns out to be just the telephone marty scrambles off the ground and answers it its doc who asks marty to meet him that night at the twin pines mall at 115 am marty asks him where hes been all week doc says that he has been working marty tells him that his equipment had been left on all week remembering doc tells marty not to hook up to the amplifier theres a slight possibility of overload he says marty glances at the destroyed amplifier and says that hell keep that in mindjust then every single one of the numerous clocks go off at once chiming loudly and doc asks about them marty tells him that its eight oclock doc is elated at the information as it means that his experiment has worked and all his clocks are 25 minutes slowmeaning it really is 825 and marty is late for school he exclaims this news into the

she warns him that the principal mr strickland james tolkan is looking for him marty tells her that his lateness is not his fault because doc set his clocks slow strickland suddenly appears at the sound of docs name he demands to know if marty is still hanging around with doc and hands him and jennifer a tardy slip each it is martys fourth in a row strickland warns marty that doc is a dangerous nuctase and if he continues hanging out with him hell get in trouble strickland also harshly tells marty that he is a slacker just like his father no mcfly ever amounted to anything in the history of hill valley he says bringing his face closer to martys until their noses touch marty counters that history will be changing soonwe change to the auditorium where a band has just finished playing four judges sit on chairs before the stage and request the next band marty and his band get up on stage and he introduces them as the pinheads before launching into the opening bars of the power of love one of the judges the songs artist huey lewis in a cameo appearance cuts them off and tells them that they are too loudafter school marty and jennifer are walking through the courthouse square as a

with her opinion that hes really good and encourages him to send in his audition tape to the record company but marty expresses fear that theyll reject him he looks up as a new 4x4 toyota pickup truck is delivered to the statler toyota dealership across the street and admires it musing about taking jennifer in it for a weekend trip to the lake jennifer asks if martys mother knows about their plans for the next night marty assures her that his mother thinks hes going camping with the guys and that she would freak out if she knew the truth marty fears his mother was probably born a nun jennifer

night of november 12 1955 the mayor would like the clock to be replaced the hill valley preservation society thinks that it is important part of their heritage and should be left alone marty gives her a quarter just to get her to go away she thanks him and hands him a flyer before going off to target more unsuspecting passersbymarty and jennifer now rid of the collection lady are about to kiss when a car pulls up and beeps its horn loudly its jennifers father coming to pick her up jennifer hastily scribbles her number on the back of the clock tower flyer with love you next to that she gets into the car marty looks at the back of the flyer he smilesmarty gets back on his skateboard and grabs a police car to tail behind he makes his way back to his home neighborhood lyon estates marty lets go of another car and skims down this opening towards his houseas marty rides up to his house he passes a wrecked bmw sedan being pushed back into the driveway by a tow truck inside martys father george mcfly crispin glover is arguing with his supervisor biff tannen thomas f wilson biff is exasperated that george loaned him a car without telling him that it had a blind spot leading him to have a headon collision with another vehicle george insists that he never knew the car had a blind spot he sees marty and gives him a weak greeting as biff demands to know who is going to pay for his cleaning bill seeing as he spilled beer all over his coattails biff then asks george if hes finished filling out biffs reports when george admits he hasnt done them yet an annoyed biff taps him several times on the head reminding george that he needs time to retype them because hell be fired if he hands in his reports in georges handwriting he expresses despair that all theyve got in the fridge is lite beer and helps himself to a beer before leaving after biff leaves george hesitantly admits to marty that he isnt good at confrontations marty asks about the car which he had been planning to drive up to the lake with jennifer george apologizesthe whole of the mcfly family later sits down to dinner  george his wife lorraine lea thompson and their children marty dave marc mcclure and linda wendie jo sperber lorraine drops a thin cake onto the table it says welcome home joey next to a picture of a bird flying out of jail uncle jailbird joey has failed to make parole again linda chides that hes an embarrassment to the family lorraine reminds her that everyone makes mistakes in lifehaving enough of the conversation dave leaves for his job as a burger king cashier while linda tells marty that jennifer called asking for him this upsets lorraine who lectures marty that any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble when linda tries to defend marty lorraine grows upset insisting that when she was lindas age she never chased a boy or called a boy or sat in a parked car with a boy linda asks how shes supposed to meet anyone if she is to go through life like lorraine did lorraine explains that it will happen just like she met george linda rolls her eyes as lorraine once again relates the story of how they met supposedly george was up in a tree just what he was doing george has never explained when he slipped fell into the street and was hit by lorraines fathers car after taking him inside and taking care of him lorraine felt sorry enough for george that she asked him to the enchantment under the sea dance which happened to be the same night the lightning bolt struck the clock tower when they had their first kiss at the dance she knew she was going to spend the rest of her life with himsometime after midnight marty is awoken by a call from doc who asks marty to stop by the lab and pick up his video camera that he forgot marty does so and heads to the twin pines mall when he gets there he finds docs van sitting in the parking lot with his dog einstein sitting nearby when marty goes down to greet einstein the rear of the van opens up and a heavily modified delorean dmc12 sedan is backed down the ramp the drivers door lifts up and doc emerges from the vehicle greeting marty then instructs marty to start recordingdoc places einstein in the delorean and buckles him in having marty note the time on the watch around einsteins collar and in docs hand both are synchronized to the same time doc then closes the deloreans door and pulls out a remote control that he uses to maneuver the delorean around the parking lot when the vehicle is a specific distance away doc puts its brakes on and starts ramping up its speed before turning off the brakes sending the delorean streaking right towards him and marty suddenly a bright light is seen from inside the delorean as additional fire and lights are set off around it and suddenly upon hitting 88 miles per hour on the speedometer the car vanishes in a puff of light and electricity leaving a pair of fire trails behind from the redhot tires doc excitedly cheers but marty is in shock as it seems that doc has just disintegrated einsteindoc excitedly exclaims that he actually sent einstein into the future one minute into the future to be exact as if on cue exactly one minute later the delorean materializes where it disappeared still traveling at the same speed as it was before and screeches to a stop now iced over as doc opens the door einstein is revealed to be alive and well with his watch now one minute behind docs doc explains that einstein likely believes that the trip was instantaneous doc shows marty a device in the cabin called the flux capacitor which makes time travel possible doc explains that after an accident in his bathroom in 1955 where he hit his head he had a vision of the flux capacitor though it took 30 years of research and most of his familys fortune to develop it the project is a success and doc plans to travel through time as he talks to marty doc absently sets the vehicles destination time to that datewhen marty asks what the delorean runs on instead of gasoline doc tells him it needs plutonium explaining that a nuclear reaction is necessary to generate 121 gigawatts to power the flux capacitor marty is alarmed asking where the doc could possibly have gotten such a substance and doc tells him that he hired a couple of libyan terrorists to steal it for him with the promise of building them a bomb doc however cheated them delivering a fake bombdoc and marty clad in yellow radiation suits load another pellet of plutonium into the delorean and doc begins his farewell address to marty and the camerajust then a volkswagen van races into the parking lot a man pops out of the roof with an ak47 and begins shooting  doc yells for marty to run in the van are the libyans that doc cheated doc tries to hide as well but that is when the libyans van comes to a stop in front of him doc throws away his revolver showing that he intends to surrender only for the libyan to shoot him full of holes marty tries to hide but is found as well when the libyan tries to shoot him his rifle jams marty jumps into the delorean and races off the van close behind as marty swings back into the parking lot he decides to see if the van can do 90 mphas he races towards a photo kiosk marty fails to see the speedometer creeping toward 88 mph or the fact that the time clock is set to november 5 1955 suddenly there is a flash of light and the kiosk and parking lot are replaced with an empty grassy field and the car plows right into a scarecrow marty is startled loses control of the delorean and crashes into a barn full of cows the noise wakes up otis peabody and his family who live in the farmhouse next door and they come outside to investigate the noise when they open the barn doors they are shocked at what they find an airplane without wings has crashed on their property peabodys son sherman decides that the delorean is actually an alien spaceship showing a comic book just then the drivers door lifts up and marty climbs out still clad in his radiation suit peabody and his family scream in terror thinking marty is an alien and flee towards the housemarty attempts to apologize for the damage when suddenly peabody returns with a shotgun and begins shooting at him marty jumps back in the delorean and speeds out of the barn peabody continuing to shoot at him as marty flees down the dirt path leading to the road he inadvertently plows through one of two small pine trees lying next to the path and protected by a picket fence peabody shoots at the car in the process destroying his own mailbox shouting you space bastard you killed our pinemarty reaches the two lane road and speeds off muttering that the experience must be a nightmare heading for home when he gets to lyon estates he finds the stone gates marking the entrance to the neighborhood but to his surprise instead of a street lined with houses there is just an empty grassy field with several construction vehicles sitting idle and a large billboard advertising the future housing development that is breaking ground next wintermarty still clad in his radiation suit sees a car coming along the road and attempts to hitchhike but the occupants are scared by martys suit and continue driving discovering that the delorean is out of gas marty removes his radiation suit and pushes the delorean back behind the billboard to hide it from passing motorists then notices a sign reading hill valley 2 milesmarty is next seen walking into the courthouse square of downtown hill valley hill valley of 1955 is a lot different to marty the courthouse square is an actual garden instead of a parking lot the essex movie theater is showing cattle queen of montana instead of a porno film the texaco station is a full service station where attendants not just fill up the tank but also wash the windows and check the customers engine and tires a mayoral campaign car drives around the square blaring reelect mayor red thomas most importantly the clock tower is still functioning as indicated when marty is surprised to hear its half hour chime marty still believes that he is in a dream but realizes this is reality when he picks up a newspaper tossed into a trash can and sees the date november 5 1955 on the top of the papermarty steps into lous diner which is the outlet for an aerobic class in 1985 at this point only inhabited by lou caruthers the owner and another customer eating breakfast at the counter marty goes to the phone booth and looks up docs address in the phonebook tearing the page out so he can look it up later as marty tries to ask for directions lou demands that marty either order something or leave marty gets himself some decaf coffee after misunderstandings about pepsi free and tabafter lou sets a coffee cup down in front of marty we now notice that the customer marty is sitting next to is his future father just then the doors fly open and in walks biff and his friends match skinhead and 3d who have come to harass george it turns out that biff has been forcing george to do his homework something george has been slacking off on when george admits that he hasnt completed biffs homework figuring that it is not due until monday biff gets annoyed and raps george on the head reminding george that he will get expelled if he hands in his homework in georges handwriting george finally agrees to finish up biffs work and hand it over the next day and biff and his friends leaveafter biff and his friends leave the diners busboy goldie wilson donald fullilove chides george for letting biff harass him all day george insists that biff is bigger than him while goldie points out that he doesnt expect to spend the rest of his own life working as a busboy and he plans on becoming someone famous one day marty immediately recognizes goldie and before realizing it blurts out to goldie that hes going to be mayor in 1985 this plants the idea in goldies mind and he begins to think about how as mayor of hill valley and how he will clean up the town to which lou responds by giving him a broom and telling him to start sweeping the floorafter george leaves the diner martys curiosity is piqued and he follows him into another neighborhood he momentarily loses track until he finds georges bike parked beneath a tree he looks up and notices george on a tree branch using a pair of binoculars to spy on a girl getting undressed in her room across the street marty is shocked to find that george is a peeping tom as hes straining to get a better look george suddenly slips and falls out of the tree landing in the street in front of an oncoming cadillac marty instinctively rushes out and pushes george out of harms way the car slams on its brakes but it hits marty who hits his head on the pavement and is knocked unconscious george gets on his bike and rides away as sam baines the driver yells to his wife that another kid has jumped in front of his carwhen marty comes around its night time and it is raining outside and he is lying in an unfamiliar bed his mothers voice tells him that hes been out for nine hours marty still semiconscious quips about having a dream that he went back in time lorraines voice reassures him that hes safe and sound in 1955 this prompts marty to bolt upright just as a lamp is turned on and he is promptly dumbstruck to see that in 1955 lorraine is a rather attractive teenage girl lorraine begins to hit on marty almost immediately thinking his name is calvin klein due to that being the brand of underwear marty is wearing marty instinctively panics when lorraine tries to make advances on him and looks like she is trying to kiss him fortunately for marty this is interrupted when lorraines mother stella calls her down for dinnerat dinner marty meets the rest of lorraines siblings including her brothers milton and toby her sister sally and in the crib nearby little baby joey stella admits that joey loves his crib and cries every time they try to take him out marty recognizes joey as the future prison inmate and cant resist the urge to joke to the baby to better get used to these bars kid the family eats while watching an episode the honeymooners on the new television set that sam has just brought home marty immediately recognizes the episode they are watching as one he has watched in 1985 which he explains by saying that he saw it in a rerun marty asks how to find docs address which lorraines father says is over on the east end of town marty knows that area as john f kennedy drive a name that lorraines father doesnt know as marty leaves the house sam warns lorraine that if she ever has a kid like marty he will disown hermarty makes his way over to docs house which will be destroyed in a fire sometime in the next 30 years which is why doc lives out of his garage in 1985 when doc who does not recognize marty answers the door we see that he has a bandage on his forehead from where he hit his head trying to hang a clock above his toilet without saying a word he immediately hooks marty up to his newest invention  a thought reader doc determines that marty comes from a great distance and wants him to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliaryfrustrated marty tells doc directly that his time machine works and he is from the future doc is skeptical even when marty shows him his future drivers license and a family photo doc comments that the photo must have been forged as daves hair is missing from the picture however marty is able to convince doc of the truth by mentioning the wound on his head that prompted the vision of the flux capacitor to prove that doc has invented it marty has doc drive him out to the place where hes hidden the delorean doc is overly delighted when he compares the drawing he made of a flux capacitor and finds the real thing installed on the deloreanafter returning to docs estate they manage to plug in martys portable television studio to see the video marty had filmed in 1985 doc becomes ecstatic when they reach the point on tape where he will say that time travel requires 121 gigawatts of energy from the plutonium to power the flux capacitor doc explains that plutonium is very hard to come by in 1955 and that the only energy source capable of that amount of power is a lightning bolt predicting the strike zone of a lightning bolt is impossible and doc tells marty he may be stuck forever in 1955 but then marty remembers the flyer the woman gave him about the lightning bolt that is going to strike the clock tower at 1004 pm next saturday night and hands it to docnow that he knows a date doc begins working on a plan to harness the power of the bolt and send marty home when marty says he can hang out in 1955 for a week doc objects warning him that it could be detrimental to future history and jeopardize his entire existence he asks marty if he had any interaction with anyone in the last few hours and marty drops the bomb about preventing the first meeting between his father and motherdoc asks to see the photo of marty and his siblings again now daves head is now completely gone this means that in order to go back to 1985 marty first needs to make his parents fall in love and have their first kiss within a weekdoc takes marty to the high school the next morning marty is amazed to find that there is no graffiti on the building unlike in 1985 after peeping through a classroom window and watching lorraine cheating on a test they spot george in the hallway during a passing period seeing him being picked on in part because of the large kick me note taped to his back george is further demoralized when strickland who in 1955 is down to his last dregs of hair appears and tells him he is a slacker doc is baffled that lorraine could fall in love with someone like george and marty admits that his best guess is she originally felt sorry for him after her dad ran over him doc recognizes their relationship as a version of the florence nightingale effect which happens when doctors develop romantic feelings for their patientsmarty tries encouraging george to talk to lorraine however an attempt to simply introduce them to each other fails because lorraine is already smitten with marty doc finds that the situation is more serious than theyd thought george lacks the selfconfidence to ask lorraine out as he fears that he couldnt handle a rejection if she said no and getting them together permanently could be impossible over lunch marty tries again to convince george by saying lorraine has been talking about him and that he should ask her to the enchantment under the sea dance george spends his lunch by himself writing science fiction short stories marty asks to read one of them and george refuses saying hes afraid people would be critical he also suggests that lorraine may want to go with someone else to the dance namely biff who we see is across the cafeteria sitting with lorraine and trying to grope her marty immediately marches over to them and pulls biff off his mother biff begins pushing marty however marty unlike his meek father begins pushing back and is about to fight biff when strickland breaks it upmarty follows george home and begins pleading with george to ask lorraine out george continues to refuse and tells marty that no one in the world will make him change his mind that night marty breaks into georges room in his radiation suit places his walkman headphones on george and gives him a blast of earsplitting eddie van halen guitar riffing marty claims he is darth vader an extraterrestrial from the planet vulcan and intimidates george into asking lorraine out threatening him with a brain melting gun actually a hairdryer to keep george from calling for his parents marty chloroforms him before jumping out the window and into docs carthe next day george rushes up to marty at the texaco station disheveled and frantic having overslept while marty is trying to open a pepsi george knows he needs to ask lorraine out but he doesnt know what he should say marty takes george back to lous diner where lorraine is hanging out with her friends marty suggests to george that he tell lorraine destiny has brought me to you george orders a chocolate milkshake to calm his nerves before approaching lorraine it gets off to a shaky start when in a fit of nervousness george accidentally mangles the lines marty gave him georges attempt comes to a grinding halt when biff and his friends come in to toss him out as biff demands money from george marty sitting at the counter accidentally trips biff biff turns his anger on marty and is about to punch him when marty tricks him into looking away giving marty the opportunity to shove biff and bolt out the dooronce outside marty grabs a passing girls scooter tears off the crate and turns the bottom into a skateboard biff and his goons chase marty in biffs car around the town square marty is able to avoid serious injury while riding on the hood of biffs car he distracts them by suddenly jumping up jumping over the windshield and the backseat and then hopping off biff and his friends are confused and then see they are barreling towards a manure truck parked on the curb they can only shout shiiiit as the car slams into the back of the truck which dumps its entire load of manure on them watching the chase from the diner lorraine becomes even more attracted to the adventurous martyback at docs shop the inventor shows marty how hell use the lighting bolt to power the delorean hell string heavy cable down to the street building a circuit a hook attached to the back of the car will channel the energy from the bolt directly into the flux capacitor the timing will have to be precise the demonstration goes well though it sets a garbage pail on fire as doc uses a fire extinguisher to put out the flames they are interrupted by a knock at the door to docs shock its lorraine who has followed marty doc and marty quickly cover the delorean with a tarp before letting lorraine in lorraine asks marty if he wants to be her date to the enchantment under the sea dance marty attempts to back out suggesting she go with george but lorraine balks at the idea saying a real man stands up for the woman he loves referring to the fight marty just had with biffmarty suddenly sees a way to get george to win lorraines heart marty approaches george while george is doing his parents laundry and tells him to find him with lorraine in docs car in the school parking lot at a certain time where marty plans to take advantage of her george is to pull marty out of the car and pretend to beat him up proving that hes the bigger manthe night of the dance arrives george is already there in a tux waiting for his cue as the allblack band known as the starlighters performs on the stage at lous diner marty writes doc a letter on a piece of stationary warning he slips the note into the pocket of docs coat while doc is in the middle of using a 50 to bribe a cop who asks him if he has a permit for his weather experimentmarty arrives at the dance in docs car with lorraine as they stop he asks her if they can park for a while lorraine produces a small bottle of whiskey and begins to smoke two bad habits she has in 1985 marty warns her she may regret it later and lorraine dismisses it exasperated that marty sounds like her mother she also is aggressive in coming on to marty in the car much more than marty had anticipated though when she kisses marty rather hard on the lips she admits afterwards that she feels like shes kissing her brotherjust then the door is opened and marty is pulled roughly from the drivers seat but to martys shock its biff drunk and seeking revenge for the 300 in damages marty inflicted on his car in the manure truck accident when biff sees lorraine in the car however he throws marty to match skinhead and 3d climbs into the car and begins to molest her match skinhead and 3d take marty out behind the school and toss him into the open trunk of the first car they see then slam the lid shut unfortunately for them the car belongs to marvin berry and the starlighters they scare biffs gang off and they realize that the keys are in the trunk with martygeorge arrives at docs car opens the door as planned and delivers the lines marty told him but is taken offguard realizing that he is not only dealing with biff but his rescue is now the real deal he takes a halfhearted punch at biff who grabs his arm and begins to twist it when biff roughly pushes a pleading lorraine off and begins laughing george summons up the strength and courage curls his left hand into a fist and punches biff squarely in the jaw knocking him out marty freed from the trunk thanks to marvin berry himself races to the scene just in time to see biff knocked out george takes lorraines hand and the two go into the dance hallmarty knowing that his future isnt sealed until george kisses lorraine goes back to the band and finds that marvin is unable to play having injured his hand while freeing marty from the trunk marty agrees to play guitar in marvins place and the band strikes up again playing a romantic song earth angel marty already weak because his parents love is not confirmed begins to fade into nonexistence when a fellow student cuts in between george and lorraine on the dance floor however george regains his courage takes lorraine back and kisses her passionately marty is instantly revived and finishes the song and sees his mother and father happily in each others armsberry asks marty to play another number with the band reluctant at first marty cant resist the opportunity and launches the band into johnny b goode while marty plays marvin berry calls his cousin chuck the soontobefamous rock n roll star telling him that he found the new sound chuck was looking for marty does chuck berrys trademark duck walk and then gets carried away imitating other guitar heroes  windmilling his arm and kicking over his amplifier in imitation of pete townshend lying on the stage kicking his legs in imitation of angus young playing behind his head like jimi hendrix and tapping in the style of eddie van halen in the face of uncomprehending stares from the audience while lost in heavy metal riffing marty stops and tells the students i guess youre not ready for that but your kids are gonna love it marty turns to leave the dance and runs into george and lorraine lorraine asks if its ok for george to take her home and marty heartily agrees he also advises them that if they have a son who accidentally sets fire to the living room rug when hes eight years old to go easy on him implying that hes talking about himselfat the town square doc waits impatiently for marty marty arrives saying he needed time to change back into his 1985 clothes as they prepare for the event doc discovers the note from marty in his pocket refusing to know too much about his future he tears up the note without reading it just then a falling tree limb disconnects the cable he has installed from the clock tower to the street doc climbs again to the clock tower and has marty feed him the cable marty also tries to warn doc about his death but is drowned out by thunder marty runs back to the delorean and races off to the starting point doc has painted for him while waiting for the timer to go off he resets his destination time to arrive 11 minutes earlier than he left so he can warn doc just then the car stalls and marty frantically tries to start it again when it does restart after the timer goes off marty begins speeding toward the town square despite some difficulty doc reconnects the cable just as the lighting bolt surges through the line and the delorean speeds off into the future leaving behind a pair of fire trails doc celebrates joyously in the streetback in 1985 around 119 am a homeless bum is seen sleeping on a bench in the town square when he is woken
