trimble scott whitney an alien phenomenon of unprecedented size and power is approaching earth destroying everything in its path the only starship in range is the uss enterprisestill in drydock after a major overhaul as captain willard decker readies his ship and his crew to face this menace admiral james t kirk arrives with orders to take command of the enterprise and intercept the intruder but it has been three years since kirk last commanded the enterprise on its historic five year mission is he up to the task of saving the earth admiral james t kirk is called upon to take command of the uss enterprise for the first time since the television series ended a strange alien craft is heading towards earth destroying everything in its path the only starship in range is the enterpriseafter undergoing a major overhaul in drydock kirk rounds up the rest of his old crew and acquires a few new members and sets off to intercept the alien spacecraft the dazzling refurbished uss enterprise soars proudly once again in this ultimate space adventure when an unidentified alien destroys three powerful klingon cruisers captain james t kirk william shatner returns to the newlytransformed uss enterprise to take command shatner is joined on this heroic mission by leonard nimoy deforest kelley and the cast from the acclaimed star trek television series the entire crew mobilizes at warp speed to stop the alien intruder from its relentless flight toward earth a strange cloud descends upon klingon vessels and eradicates them with an energy bolt the epsilon ix space station alerts the federation but they too are wiped out by the entity the starship assigned to the case is what else the ncc1701 that would be the registration number for the uss enterprise which has been rebuilt thus the entire original crew you knew from the television series returns although they are prepared to face the entity nothing will prepare them for the ride to come the film asks the question paul gauguin asks in a painting bearing this name where do i come from what am i where am i going in klingon space three klingon battle cruisers encounter a huge cloudlike anomaly on the bridge of one of the ships the captain mark lenard orders his crew to fire torpedoes at it but they have no effect the ships take evasive actionmeanwhile in federation space a monitoring station epsilon 9 picks up a distress signal from one of the klingon ships as the three ships are attempting to escape the cloud energy beams shoot out and engulf each ship one by one and they vanish on epsilon 9 the crew tracks the course of the cloud and discovers that it is headed for earthon vulcan spock leonard nimoy has been undergoing the kohlinahr ritual in which he has been learning how to purge all of his emotions and is nearly finished with his training a female vulcan master edna glover surrounded by two men is about to give him an ornate necklace as a symbol of pure logic when spock holds out his hand to stop her confused she mindmelds with him and senses a consciousness calling to him from space that is affecting his human side she drops the necklace you have not yet achieved kohlinahr you must look elsewhere for your answer she says as they leave spock you will not find it herein san francisco admiral james t kirk william shatner arrives at starfleet headquarters in a shuttlecraft he sees commander sonak jon rashad kamal a vulcan science officer who is joining the enterprise crew and recommended for the position by kirk himself kirk is bothered as to why sonak is not on board yet sonak explains that captain willard decker stephen collins the new captain of the enterprise wanted him to complete his science briefing at headquarters before they left on their mission the enterprise has been undergoing a complete refitting for the past 18 months and is now under final preparations to leave which would take at least 20 hours but kirk informs him that they only have 12 he tells sonak to report to him on the enterprise in one hour he has a short meeting with admiral nogura and is intent on being on the shipkirk transports to an office complex orbiting earth and meets montgomery scott james doohan the enterprises chief engineer scotty expresses his concern about the tight departure time the cloud is less than three days away from earth and the enterprise has been ordered to intercept it because they are the only ship in range scotty says that the refit cant be finished in 12 hours and tries to convince him that the ship needs more work done as well as a shakedown cruise kirk insists that they are leaving ready or not they board a travel pod and begin the journey over to the drydock in orbit that houses the enterprisescotty tells kirk that the crew hasnt had enough transition time with all the new equipment and that the engines havent even been tested at warp power not to mention that they have an untried captain kirk tells scotty that two and a half years as chief of starfleet operations may have made him a little stale but that he wouldnt exactly consider himself untried kirk then tells a surprised scotty that starfleet gave him back his command of the enterprise scotty doubts it saying that he doesnt think it was that easy with admiral nogura who gave kirk his orders they arrive at the enterprise and scotty indulges kirk with a brief tour of the new exterior of the shipupon docking with the ship scotty is summoned to engineering kirk goes up to the bridge and is informed by lt uhura nichelle nichols that starfleet has just transferred command from captain decker over to him kirk finds decker in engineering whom is visibly upset when kirk breaks the news that he is assuming command but recognizes it is because kirk has more experience decker will remain on the ship as 2nd officer as decker storms off an alarm sounds someone is trying to beam over to the ship but the transporter is malfunctioning kirk and scotty race to the transporter room transporter operator janice rand grace lee whitney is frantically trying to tell starfleet to abort the transport but it is too late commander sonak and an unknown female officer are beaming in but their bodies arent reforming properly in the beam the female officer screams and then their bodies disappear starfleet signals to them that they have died kirk tells starfleet to express his sympathies to their familiesin the corridor kirk sees decker and tells him they will have to replace commander sonak and wants another vulcan decker tells him that no one is available that is familiar with the ships new design kirk tells decker he will have to double his duties as science officer as wellin the recreation room as kirk briefs the assembled crew on the mission they receive a transmission from epsilon 9 commander branch david gautreaux tells them they have analyzed the mysterious cloud it generates an immense amount of energy and measures 2 aus 300 million km in diameter there is also a vessel of some kind in the center theyve tried to communicate with it and have performed scans but the cloud reflects them back it seems to think of the scans as hostile and attacks them like the klingon ships earlier epsilon 9 disappearslater on the bridge uhura informs kirk that the transporter is working now lt ilia persis khambatta a bald being from the planet delta iv arrives decker is happy to see her as they developed a romantic relationship when he was assigned to her planet several years earlier ilia is curious about deckers reduction in rank and kirk interrupts and tells her about decker being the executive and science officer decker tells her with slight sarcasm that kirk has the utmost confidence in him ilia tells kirk that her oath of celibacy is on record and asks permission to assume her duties uhura tells kirk that one of the last few crew members to arrive is refusing to beam up kirk goes to the transporter room to ensure that he beams upkirk tells starfleet to beam the officer aboard dr leonard bones mccoy deforest kelley materializes on the platform mccoy is angry that his starfleet commission was reactivated and that it was kirks idea for him to be brought along on the mission his attitude changes however when kirk says he desperately needs him mccoy leaves to check out the new sickbaythe crew finishes its repairs and the enterprise leaves drydock and into the solar system dr mccoy comes up to the bridge and complains that the new sickbay is nothing but a computer center kirk is anxious to intercept the cloud intruder and orders hikaru sulu george takei to go to warp speed suddenly the ship enters a wormhole which was created by an engine imbalance and is about to collide with an asteroid that has been pulled inside kirk orders the phasers to be fired on it but decker tells pavel chekov walter koenig to fire photon torpedoes instead the asteroid and the wormhole are destroyed annoyed kirk wants to meet with decker in his quarters dr mccoy decides to go alongkirk demands an explanation from decker decker pointed out that the redesigned enterprise channeled the phasers through the main engines and because they were imbalanced the phasers were cut off kirk acknowledged that he had saved the ship however he accuses decker of competing with him decker tells kirk that because of his unfamiliarity with the ships new design the mission is in jeopardy decker tells kirk that he will gladly help kirk understand the new design kirk then dismisses him from the room in the corridor decker runs into ilia ilia asked if the confrontation was difficult and he tells her that it was about as difficult as seeing her again and apologizes she asked if he was sorry for leaving delta iv or for not saying goodbye he said that if he had seen her again would she be able to say goodbye she says no and walked around him and entered her quarters nearbyback in kirks quarters mccoy accuses kirk of being the one who was competing and the fact that it was kirk who used the emergency to pressure starfleet into letting him get command of the enterprise mccoy thinks that kirk is obsessed with keeping his command on kirks console viewscreen uhura informs kirk that a shuttlecraft is approaching and that the occupant wishes to dock chekov also pipes in and replies that it appears to be a courier vessel kirk tells chekov to handle the situationthe shuttle approaches the enterprise from behind and the top portion of it detaches and docks at an airlock behind the bridge chekov is waiting by the airlock doors and is surprised to see spock come aboard moments later spock arrives on the bridge and everyone is shocked and pleased to see him yet spock ignores them he moves over to the science station and tells kirk that he is aware of the crisis and knows about the ships engine design difficulties he offers to step in as the science officer mccoy and dr christine chapel majel barret roddenberry come to the bridge to greet spock but spock just stares alarmingly at their emotional outburst spock leaves to discuss fuel equations with scotty in engineeringwith spocks assistance the engines are now rebalanced for full warp capacity the ship successfully goes to warp to intercept the cloud in the officers lounge spock meets with kirk and mccoy they discuss spocks kohlinahr training on vulcan and how spock broke off from his training to join them spock describes how he sensed the consciousness of the intruder from a source more powerful that he has ever encountered with perfect logical thought patterns he believes that it holds the answers he seeks uhura tells kirk over the intercom that they have visual contact with the intruderthe cloud scans the ship but kirk orders no return scans spock determines that the scans are coming from the center of the cloud uhura tries sending linguacode messages but there is no response decker suggests raising the shields for protection but kirk determines that that might be considered hostile to the cloud spock analyzes the clouds composition and discovers it has a 12power energy field the equivalent of power generated by thousands of starshipssitting at the science station spock awakens from a brief trance he reveals to kirk that the alien was communicating with him the alien is puzzled it contacted the enterprisewhy has the enterprise not replied a red alert sounds and an energy beam from within the cloud touches the ship and begins to overload the ships systems bolts of lightning surround the warp core and nearly injure some engineering officers and chekov is also hurthis hand is burned while sitting at the weapons station on the bridge the energy beam then disappears a medical team is summoned to the bridge and ilia is able to use her telepathic powers to soothe chekovs painspock confirms to kirk that the alien has been attempting to communicate it communicates at a frequency of more than one million megahertz and at such a high rate of speed the message only lasts a millisecond spock programs to computer to send linguacode messages at that frequency another energy beam is sent out but spock transmits a message just in time and the beam disappears the ship continues on course through the cloud they pass through many expansive and colorful cloud layers and upon clearing these a giant vessel is revealed it is roughly cylindrical in shape with large spikes jutting out from the surface at equidistant angles between each other forming a hexagonlike shapekirk tells uhura to transmit an image of the alien to starfleet but she explains that any transmission sent out of the cloud is being reflected back to them kirk orders sulu to fly above and along the top of the vessel the enterprise is so small compared to the size of the alien vessel that it appears only as a little white dot next to it the ship travels past many oddlyshaped structures including a sunken area where the energy beams originatean alarm sounds and yet another energy bolt approaches the ship it appears on the bridge as a column of bright light that emits a very loud noise the crew struggles to shield their eyes from its brilliant glow chekov asks spock if it is one of the aliens crew and spock replies that it is a probe sent from the vessel the probe slowly moves around the room and stops in front of the science station bolts of lightning shoot out from it and surround the consoleit is trying to access the ships computer spock manages to smash the controls to prevent further access and the probe gives him an electric shock that sends him rolling onto the floor the probe approaches the helmnavigation console and it scans lt ilia suddenly she vanishes along with the probeahead of the ship looms another giant section of the vessel a tractor beam is drawing the enterprise toward an opening aperture decker calls for chief difalco marcy lafferty to come up to the bridge as ilias replacement the ship travels deep into the next chamber decker wonders why they were brought insidethey could have been easily destroyed outside spock deduces that the alien is curious about them uhuras monitor shows that the aperture is closing they are trapped the ship is released from the tractor beam and suddenly an intruder alert goes off someone has come aboard the ship and is in the crew quarters sectionkirk and spock arrive inside a crewmans quarters to discover that the intruder is inside the sonic shower it is revealed to be ilia although it isnt really herthere is a small red device attached to her neck in a mechanized voice she replies you are the kirk unityou will listen to me she explains that she has been programmed by an entity called vger to observe and record the normal functions of the carbonbased units humans infesting the enterprise kirk opens the shower door and ilia steps out wearing a small white garment that just materialized around her dr mccoy and a security officer enter the room and kirk tells mccoy to scan her with a tricorderkirk asks her who vger is she replies vger is that which programmed me mccoy tells kirk that ilia is a mechanism and spock confirms she is a probe that assumed ilias physical form kirk asks where the real ilia is and the probe states that that unit no longer functions kirk also asks why vger is traveling to earth and the probe answers that it wishes to find the creator join with him and become one with it spock suggests that mccoy perform a complete examination of the probein sickbay the ilia probe lays on a diagnostic table its sensors slowly taking readings all normal body functions down to the microscopic level are exactly duplicated by the probe decker arrives and is stunned to see her there she looks up at him and addresses him as decker rather than decker unit which intrigues spock spock talks with kirk and decker in an adjoining room and spock locks the door spock theorizes that the real ilias memories and feelings have been duplicated by the probe as well as her body decker is angry that the probe killed ilia but kirk convinces him that their only contact with the vessel is through the probe and they need to use that advantage to find out more about the alien suddenly the probe bursts through the door and demands that kirk assist her with her observations he tells her that decker will do it with more efficiencydecker and ilia are seen walking around in the recreation room he shows her pictures of previous ships that were named enterprise decker has been trying to see if ilias memories or emotions can resurface but to no avail kirk and mccoy are observing them covertly on a monitor from his quarters decker shows her a game that the crew enjoys playing she is not interested and states that recreation and enjoyment has no meaning to her programming at another game which ilia enjoyed and nearly always won they both press one of their hands down onto a table to play it the table lights up indicating she won the game and she gazes into deckers eyes this moment of emotion ends suddenly and she returns to normal this device serves no purposewhy does the enterprise require the presence of carbon units she asks decker tells her the ship couldnt function without them she tells him that more information is needed before the crew can be patterned for data storage horrified he asks her what this means when my examination is complete all carbon units will be reduced to data patterns he tells her that within her are the memory patterns of a certain carbon unit he convinces her to let him help her revive those patterns so that she can understand their functions better she allows him to proceedspock slowly enters an airlock room he sees an officer standing at a console his back to spock spock quietly approaches him and gives him the vulcan nerve pinch to render him unconsciousdecker the probe dr mccoy and dr chapel are in ilias quarters dr chapel gives the probe a decorative headband that ilia used to wear chapel puts it over ilias head and turns her toward a mirror decker asks her if she remembers wearing it on delta iv the probe shows another moment of emotion saying dr chapels name and putting her hand on deckers face calling him will behind them mccoy reminds decker that she is a mechanism decker asks ilia to help them make contact with vger she says that she cant and decker asks her who the creator is she says vger does not know the probe becomes emotionless again and removes the headbandspock is now outside the ship in a space suit with an attached thruster pack he begins recording a log entry for kirk detailing his attempt to contact the alien he activates a panel on the suit and calculates thruster ignition and acceleration to coincide with the opening of an aperture ahead of him he hopes to get a better view of the spacecraft interiorkirk comes up to the bridge and uhura tells him that starfleet signals are growing stronger indicating they are very close to earth starfleet is monitoring the intruder and notifies uhura that it is slowing down in its approach sulu confirms this and says that lunar beacons show the intruder is entering into orbit chekov tells kirk that airlock 4 has been opened and a thruster suit is missing kirk figures out that spock has done it and orders chekov to get spock back on the ship he changes his mind and instead tells him to determine his positionspock touches a button on his thruster panel and his thruster engine ignites he is propelled forward rapidly and enters the next chamber of the vessel just before the aperture closes behind him the thruster engine shuts down and the momentum carries spock ahead further he disconnects the thruster pack from his suit and it falls away from himcontinuing his log entry spock sees an image of what he believes to be vgers home planet he passes through a tunnel filled with crackling plasma energy possibly a power source for a gigantic imaging system next he sees several more images of planets moons stars and galaxies stored and recorded spock theorizes that this may be a visual representation of vgers entire journey but who or what are we dealing with he pondershe sees the epsilon 9 station and notes to kirk that he is convinced that all of what he is seeing is vger and that they are inside a living machine then he sees a giant image of lt ilia with the sensor on her neck spock decides it must have some special meaning so he attempts to mindmeld with it he is quickly overwhelmed by the multitude of images flooding his mind and is thrown backwardkirk is now in a space suit and has exited the ship the aperture in front of the enterprise opens and spocks unconscious body floats toward him later dr chapel and dr mccoy are examining spock in sickbay dr mccoy performs scans and determines that spock endured massive neurological trauma from the mindmeld spock tells kirk he should have known and kirk asks if he was right about vger spock calls it a conscious living entity kirk explains that vger considers the enterprise a living machine and its why ilia refers to the ship as an entity and the crew as an infestationspock describes vgers homeworld as a planet populated by living machines with unbelievable technology but with all that logic and knowledge vger is barren with no mystery or meaning he momentarily lapses into sleep but kirk rouses him awake to ask what spock should have known spock grasps kirks hand and tells him this simple feeling is beyond vgers comprehension no meaning no hope and jim no answers its asking questions is this all that i am is there nothing moreuhura chimes in and tells kirk that they are getting a faint signal from starfleet the intruder has been on their monitors for a while and the cloud is rapidly dissipating as it approaches sulu also comments that the intruder has slowed to subwarp speed and is three minutes from earth orbit kirk acknowledges and he mccoy and spock go up to the bridgestarfleet sends the enterprise a tactical report on the intruders position uhura tells kirk that vger is transmitting a signal decker and ilia come up to the bridge and she says that vger is signaling the creator spock determines that the transmission is a radio signal decker tells kirk that vger expects an answer but kirk doesnt know the question then ilia says that the creator has not responded an energy bolt is released from vger and positions itself above earth chekov reports that all planetary defense systems have just gone inoperative several more bolts are released and they all split apart to form smaller ones and they assume equidistant positions around the planetmccoy notices that the bolts are the same ones that hit the ship earlier and spock says that these are hundreds of times more powerful and from those positions they can destroy all life on earth why kirk asks ilia she says that the carbon unit infestation will be removed from the creators planet as they are interfering with the creators ability to respond and accuses the crew of infesting the enterprise and interfering in the same manner kirk tells ilia that carbon units are a natural function of the creators planet and they are living things not infestations however ilia says they are not true life forms like the creator mccoy realizes vger must think its creator is a machinespock compares vger to a child and suggests they treat it like one mccoy retorts that this child is about to wipe out every living thing on earth to get ilias attention kirk says that the carbon units know why the creator hasnt responded the ilia probe demands that the creator disclose the information kirk wont do it until vger withdraws all the orbiting devices in response to this vger cuts off the ships communications with starfleet she tells him again to disclose the information he refuses and a plasma energy attack shakes the ship mccoy tells spock that the child is having a tantrumkirk tells the probe that if vger destroys the enterprise then the information it needs will also be destroyed ilia says that it is illogical to withhold the required information and asks him why he wont disclose it kirk explains it is because vger is going to destroy all life on earth ilia says that they have oppressed the creator and kirk makes it clear he will not disclose anything vger needs the information says ilia kirk says that vger will have to withdraw all the orbiting devices ilia says that vger will comply if the carbon units give the informationspock tells kirk that vger must have a central brain complex kirk theorizes that the orbiting devices are controlled from there kirk tells ilia that the information cant be disclosed to vgers probe but only to vger itself ilia stares at the viewscreen and in response the aperture opens and drags the ship forward with a tractor beam into the next chamber chekov tells kirk that the energy bolts will reach their final positions and activate in 27 minutes kirk calls to scotty on the intercom and tells him to stand by to execute starfleet order 2005 the selfdestruct command a female crewmember asks scotty why kirk ordered selfdestruct and scotty tells her that kirk hopes that when they explode so will the intruderthe countdown is now down to 18 minutes difalco reports that they have traveled 17 kilometers inside the vessel kirk goes over to spocks station and sees that spock has been crying not for us kirk realizes spock tells him he is crying for vger and that he weeps for vger as he would for a brother as he was when he came aboard the enterprise so is vger nowempty incomplete and searching logic and knowledge are not enough mccoy realizes spock has found what he needed but that vger hasnt decker wonders what vger would need to fulfill itselfspock comments that each one of us at some point in our lives asks why am i here what was i meant to be vger hopes to touch its creator and find those answers difalco directs kirks attention to the viewscreen ahead of them is a structure with a bright light sulu reports that forward motion has stopped chekov replies that an oxygengravity envelope has formed outside of the ship ilia points to the structure on the screen and identifies it as vger uhura has located the source of the radio signal and it is straight ahead a passageway forms outside the ship as kirk spock mccoy decker and ilia enter a turboliftthe landing party exits an airlock on the top of the saucer section and walks up the passageway at the end of the path is a concave structure and in the center of it is an old nasa probe from three centuries earlier kirk tries to rub away the smudges on the nameplate and makes out the letters v g e r he continues to rub and discovers that the craft is actually voyager 6 kirk recalls the history of the voyager programit was designed to collect data and transmit it back to earth decker tells kirk that voyager 6 disappeared through a black holekirk says that it must have emerged on the far side of the galaxy and got caught in the machine planets gravity spock theorizes that the planets inhabitants found the probe to be one of their own kindprimitive yet kindred they discovered the probes 20th century programming which was to collect data and return that information to its creator the machines interpreted that instruction literally and constructed the entire vessel so that voyager could fulfill its programming kirk continues by saying that on its journey back it amassed so much knowledge that it gained its own consciousnessilia tells kirk that vger awaits the information kirk calls uhura on his communicator and tells her to find information on the probe in the ships computer specifically the nasa code signal which will allow the probe to transmit its data decker realizes that that is what the probe was signalingits ready to transmit everything kirk then says that there is no one on earth who recognizes the oldstyle signalthe creator does not answerkirk calls out to vger and says that they are the creator ilia says that is not logicalcarbon units are not true life forms kirk says they will prove it by allowing vger to complete its programming uhura calls kirk on his communicator and tells him she has retrieved the code kirk tells her to set the enterprise transmitter to the code frequency and to transmit the signal decker reads off the numerical code on his tricorder and is about to read the final sequence but voyagers circuitry burns out an effort by vger itself to prevent the last part of the code from being transmittedilia says that the creator must join with vger and turns toward decker mccoy warns kirk that they only have 10 minutes left decker figures out that vger wanted to bring the creator here and transmit the code in person spock tells kirk that vgers knowledge has reached the limits of the universe and it must evolve kirk says that vger needs a human quality in order to evolve decker thinks that vger joining with the creator will accomplish that he then goes over to the damaged circuitry and fixes the wires so he can manually enter the rest of the code through the ground test computer kirk tries to stop him but ilia tosses him aside decker tells kirk that he wants this as much as kirk wanted the enterprisesuddenly a bright light forms around deckers body ilia moves over to him and the light encompasses them both as they merge together their bodies disappear and the light expands and begins to consume the area kirk spock and mccoy retreat back to the enterprise vger explodes leaving the enterprise above earth unharmed on the bridge kirk wonders if they just saw the beginning of a new life form and spock says yes and that it is possibly the next step in their evolution mccoy says that its been a while since he delivered a baby and hopes that they got this one off to a good startuhura tells kirk that starfleet is requesting the ships damage and injury reports and vessel status kirk reports that there were only two casualties lt ilia and captain decker he quickly corrects his statement and changes their status to missing vessel status fully operational scotty comes on the bridge and agrees with kirk that its time to give the enterprise a proper shakedown when scotty offers to have spock back on vulcan in four days spock says thats unnecessary as his task on vulcan is completedkirk tells sulu to proceed ahead at warp factor one when difalco asks for a heading kirk simply says out there thataway with that the enterprise flies
