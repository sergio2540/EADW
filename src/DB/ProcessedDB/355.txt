pickens jr michael keys hall ralph tabakin huey lewis 1000 feet below the ocean navy divers discover an object halfamile long a crack team of scientists are deployed to the site in deepsea habitats what they find boggles the mind as they discover a perfect metal sphere what is the secret behind the sphere will they survive the mysterious manifestations who or what is creating these they may never live to find out the psychiatrist dr norman goodman travels from san diego to the middle of nowhere in the pacific ocean to help survivors of a plane crash soon he learns that he was actually summoned by captain harold c barnes to teamup with the biochemistry dr elizabeth beth halperin the mathematician dr harry adams and the astrophysical dr ted fielding to investigate an unknown life form in a spacecraft that crashed two hundred and eightyeight years ago the team saturates with helium to travel to a base close to the ufo 1000 feet below the ocean and operated by the military alice teeny fletcher and jane edmunds barnes norman beth harry and ted go to the spaceship and discover that it is terrestrial from the future further the computer indicates an unknown entry event probably a black hole that brought the spaceship to the past harry uses logic and concludes that if the crew had never heard anything about their discovery in the present days they will probably dies but they all are intrigued with a mysterious sphere inside the spacecraft there is a storm in the surface and the fleet must leave the area leaving barnes and his team without communication harry sneaks out and enters in the sphere and then his manifestations come to life threatening the group will they survive to the power of the mysterious sphere in the middle of the south pacific a thousand feet below the surface of the water a huge vessel rests on the ocean floor rushed to the scene is a group of american scientists who descend to the depths of the sea to investigate this astonishing discovery what they find defies their imaginations and mocks their attempts at logical explanation it is a massive spaceship undamaged from its fall from the skyand at least three hundred years old dr norman goodman dustin hoffman is called to a location in the pacific ocean for what he thinks is a plane crash his specialty is psychiatry and dealing with crash survivors the helicopter pilot huey lewis  yes that huey lewis tells him theyve been ferrying all kinds of scientists to this locationonboard a naval ship norman sees astrophysicist dr ted fielding liev schriber and biochemist dr beth halperin sharon stone but is unable to talk to them the ships captain harold barnes peter coyote briefs them  the plane crash is a spacecraft a huge ship buried under 300 years of coral in addition to beth norman and ted mathematician dr harry adams samuel l jackson is also on the contact team which was recommended by norman many years agothe team goes through a medical examination and a dive briefing by an instructor james pickens jr who tells them there is no quick return to the surface the team takes a sub to the crash site habitat and they all begin to exhibit signs of nervousness its clear that norman and beth have some history the habitat is manned by edmunds marga gomez and alice fletcher queen latifah who is directing a navy dive team to set up a drone by the ships doorthe team puts on dive suits and walks on the seafloor to the spacecraft and the door opens for them beth sees footprints in the dust and barnes splits them into 2 groups beth and norman step onto an elevator which takes them to the bridge ted harry and barnes find english text and advanced metallurgy beth finds a human skeleton and deduces the ship is american the flight recorder shows dates from the future and an entry for unknown entry event a holographic display reveals that the ship travelled through a black hole the team finds a huge sphere in a cargo hold the sphere doesnt reflect the team members but everything elseback in the habitat ted theorizes that the ship timetravelled through a black hole and arrived 300 years ago harry thinks the sphere is alive and that since the future ship has no information about the black hole the contact team will not get a chance to warn anyone therefore they are destined to die in the habitat he also expresses a desire to get into the sphere at the same time barnes gets a message that a cyclone is approaching topside and the team must return to the surface before it hitsas the team is preparing to return alarms go off and video monitors show harry entering the sphere through his reflection due to harrys disappearance the return to the surface is cancelled norman goes to the sphere and finds harry at its base unconscious norman sees his reflection in the sphere and communications with the surface are suddenly interrupted harry is taken back to the sphere as is normannorman sits gazing out a window and sees a jellyfish fletcher takes some tapes to the minisub outside and is attacked and killed by jellyfish beth later analyzes the jellyfish and determines its not a normal one barnes questions norman about beths mental state and harry wakes up from his coma feeling exuberant and making comments about never leaving he appears calm about fletchers death but freaks out over calamarilater as norman and ted argue over teds jealousy on harry edmunds bring the to the communications center where the computers are acting strangely harry notices the codes on the computer are in binary code after decryption the messages reads hello how are you i am fine what is your name my name is jerry norman worries that jerry appears to have emotions and what the repercussions would be if jerry gets madlater they hear noise outside the habitat and norman and beth investigate finding edmunds mangled body outside meanwhile harry reads 20000 leagues under the sea norman and beth bring edmunds body back inside and are attacked by strange egg shapes with something large approachingnorman tries to contact jerry and discovers jerry can hear them directly when norman asks to talk without jerry listening and jerry becomes petulant and a large squid approaches the habitat jerry says via computer i am here and the squid attacks ted bashes his head while adjusting the internal pressure and norman activate the external defense system which causes a fire as they rush to combat the fire jerry states i will kill you all ted tries to wake harry but cant barnes get crushed by an emergency door and ted is killed by fire then the fire suddenly is extinguishedafter the emergency norman talks to jerry who exhibits a childlike understanding of life but immense power jerry tells norman to stop calling him jerry norman then talks to harry who is calm but unaware of the incidents norman goes to reset the minisub but on the way back he gets holes in his suit harry watches dispassionately and directs norman to the airlock but norman is attacked by a sea snakebeth goes into the spaceship saying shes looking for food distrust arises among the 3 survivors as beth was supposed to be monitoring norman during his trek norman finds another copy of 20000 leagues under the sea and then the entire pantry is full of copies beth plants mines around the spaceshipnorman recalculates the code and realizes the j and e are incorrect  they should be h and a which means jerry is actually harry later norman explains this to beth and also explains the squid  its a part of 20000 leagues under the sea norman theorizes the sphere made the change in harry beth and harry plot to sedate harry and he goes under quicklybeth and harry get a signal from topside that a sub will arrive in 6 hours norman is attacked by sea snakes in the bathroom but beth saves him without emotion saying norman manifested the snakes she locks him inside the lab and tells him to sedate himself when he refuses she flood the lab and norman goes outside the habitat returning through the main airlock meanwhile beth begins to doubt her own sanity and harry wakes up norman realizes that all 3 of them went into the sphere and that is what happened to the original crewthe explosives beth set become armed with 13 minutes remaining the 3 head to the minisub reality keeps changing but norman finds a way to launch the sub the bombs explode destroying the spaceship and habitat but the minisub makes it to the surfaceseveral hours later the 3 complete decompression and discuss their story norman reminds harry that they shouldnt be alive since they made it to the surface and could tell the authorities what happened harry suggests they use their power to forget that they have the power they count to three and the sphere rises from the deep and disappears into outer space beth harry and norman have successfully forgotten their powerperhaps 6.0sphere ocean spaceship scientist manifestation spacecraft diver ufo imagination bottom of the ocean
