carriage and renfield tumbles out headfirst the driver throws his luggage down after him saying he will go no further tonight renfield is forced to walk to his appointment at draculas castle disregarding the townspeoples warnings about vampires as a silly superstitionby the time renfield arrives it is dark he tries to knock at the door but the knocker crumbles away in his hand just then the doors swing open of their own accord when renfield steps in the doors swing shut again and he turns around in surprise behind him at the top of a long staircase count dracula leslie nielsen makes his appearance he stands still at the top of the stairs as shadow creeps forward across the wall in a predatory stance dracula scolds it in a foreign tongue and it retreats renfield startled turns around and is relieved to see the count dracula starts to introduce himself and trips on some bat guano tumbling down the steps he gets up at renfields feet unharmed he leads renfield up the staircase while his shadow limps across the wall behind himas they walk up the stairs dracula passes without incident through a giant spiderweb that is in the way renfield confused attempts to follow only to become tangled in the web he is still picking cobwebs off his clothes as he enters the room into which dracula has led him dracula brings up his purchase of carfax abbey renfield produces the documents just as dracula is about to sign renfield gets a papercut blood spurts all over the documents as renfield attempts to find his hankerchief dracula smacks his lips and looks on in interestlater that night renfield is sleeping soundly in the guest room the door creaks open and two vampire maidens float into the room renfield wakes up to see them molesting his furniture he is indignant at their intrusion but when they advance upon him he soon gives in to their mistrations with gusto dracula walks by to see them in a very comprimising position he calls the vampires off and scolds them they start to float out of the room but he tells them to stop it so they just stomp into the halldracula finds renfield cowering under the covers and tells him he was having a nightmare he offers to show renfield an old transylvanian method of relaxation where the other will stare deeply into his eyes however renfield promptly falls asleep before dracula can make him his slave this happens once more before dracula hoists renfield up by his shoulders and goes through it all very fast renfields eyes get wider and more twitchy as he listens and the scene ends with renfield totally under draculas controlthe next scene opens on a ship at sea it is the demeter bound for england draculas coffin is down below being knocked about the cabin renfield enters and tries to tie down the coffin again only to be crushed against the wall multiple times by the rocking ship when renfield finally manages to tie down the coffin dracula emerges with a groan renfield says he looks dried out

and reaches out to push the window shut it swings shut and dracula flies into it headon sliding down the glass afterwards in human form he pushes in the window and hoists himself up onto the sill and into the room suddenly a knock sounds at the door dr seward and jonathan come in and turn on the light saying they thought they heard a prowler they search the room and find nothing while dracula

the chandalier directly above he grumbles that he must move his coffingarlic drapes over every surface in lucys room that night she complains about the smell but dr seward and dr van helsing insist
