france and england henry v is debating whether he has the right to claim french territories under a property contract presumably advocated by the clergy between france and england at some prior date citation neededprologue bear with us as we attempt to retell the story of henry v at agincourt though our stage is an unworthy scaffold a shallow representation of the events which transpired before during and afteras the play unfolds we see the clergy in a meeting about the kings seeming indifference of its claim on technicalityto the french kingdom there is a gathering of the kings subjects to hear details from the clergy as to why england has the right to claim the lands of the french according to the clergy by contract from previous encounters the french must have a male heir but at present have a female one which effectually nullifies french royaltys claim to the french kingdomthe king warns the clergy to state the facts  any other entreaty would lead to much fall of blood which is expected due to the two contending kingdoms property to be certain he is within his rights to claim french territories he orders the clergyman to be bluntdoes england have the right to make a claim of francethe clergyman says yes and that if it is a sin let it be on his headfurthermore the clergyman states that the winning back of such land would bring vast sums of money to the clergy and king of england this information is what makes henry finally decide to go to war if the french renege on the contractthe king has already made a claim to france upon this advisement and the herald of france is brought before the king with frances answer to this claim the dauphin of france says the king savors too much of his youth and offers in return a gift of tennis ballshenry at first calmly thanks the herald for his time and message but then proceeds to admonish the sender for his childish joke and states they will play a set of tennis which will strike the dauphins fathers crown in to the hazardthroughout henrys subjects are present and are surprised to see the king take up his mantle with a gusto not seen previously the king apparently was not very studious as a youth and pursued courses vain such as sport and partying thus they see an apparent change in their king which is suitable to his stationafter meeting with the herald and dismissing him back to france with his message henry says he will be no king of england unless he is king of france and france being his will be bent to his oar or broken all to piecesthen it begins 7.8king france england battle king of france
