dana vargas after the terrifying events in la john mcclane willis is about to go through it all again a team of terrorists led by col stuart sadler is holding the entire airport hostage the terrorists are planning to rescue a drug lord from justice in order to do so they have seized control of all electrical equipment affecting all planes with no runway lights available all aircraft have to remain in the air with fuel running low mcclane will need to be fast john mcclane the new york cop who took on single handed some men who took over the office building where his wife worked a year ago is now at dulles airport waiting for his wife to arrive so they can spend christmas with her family but it turns out that a south american president who became a drug dealer after the us withdrew support is arriving to be handed to american authorities and mcclane notices some men acting strangely so he follows them and they start shooting at him and he shoots back mcclane tries to talk to the chief of the airport police but the guy doesnt want to listen so mcclane gets the fingerprints of the man he killed and has his friend at the lapd check it out and he finds out that the man officially died two years ago so mcclane thinks the guy is part of a black op and tries to tell the manager but before they could act on it the airports system goes out and thats when someone calls them and tells them that theyve taken control of their system so they cant contact any of the planes who are arriving and give them landing instructions and some of the planes have little fuel and among them is the one mcclanes wife is on mcclane tries to stop them once again new york cop john mcclane is in the wrong place at the wrong time  this time hes waiting for his wifes plane to arrive at washingtons dulles airport when he uncovers a plot to sabotage the airports landing system the criminals wish to free a drug baron being extradited to america for trial by holding the airport to ransom until they all safely escape on another plane however if theyd known that holly mcclane was on a flight home to the very airport they were hijacking they would have picked another day john mcclain is again trapped in a difficult situation with his wife on an airplane circling dulles airport in washington terrorists take over the landing system and black out the airport as the airport authorities seem to challenge his every move john must defeat the terrorists and allow the planes to land before they run out of fuel john mcclane a los angeles police officer is awaiting the arrival of his wife at washington airport also scheduled for this evening is a flight from south america which should bring a drug dealer back to the united states a team of high tech gangsters manage to take over the airports radar facility they want to free the drug dealer but they have only one little problem john mcclane its christmas eve one year after the nakatomi plaza siege that took place in los angeles lieutenant john mcclane of the lapd is at the dulles international airport in dulles virginia waiting for the flight his wife holly is on as their kids are visiting hollys parents in nearby washington dc it wont be easy getting holly to her parents house because her mothers car which john is using at the moment has been towed there is also a breaking news story that all of the networks are covering at the escelan airport in the republic of valverde an airplane carrying general ramon esperanza has taken off on course for the dulles international airport two years ago esperanza led his countrys army in a campaign against communist insurgents and it was a campaign that was fought with american money and advisers esperanzas fall from power caused ripples not only in his countrys recent election but in the usa as well when high ranking pentagon officials were charged with supplying esperanza with weapons despite the congressional ban but mounting evidence that esperanzas forces have violated the neutrality of neighboring countries made congress withhold funds esperanza is accused of replacing those funds by going into the business of cocaine smuggling and now esperanza is being transported to the usa to face drug charges using her airplanes phone holly informs john that the airplane will land half an hour latebut itll actually be much later than that on hollys airplane one of her fellow passengers is richard dick thornburg the news reporter who filed a restraining order against holly after holly knocked out two of dicks teeth last year the restraining order says that holly is not to be within 50 feet of dick the control tower staff led by chief of air operations trudeau and his chief engineer leslie barnes is worried about the weather as one snowstorm system moves out another one is moving in which means that all incoming flights are delayed and washington dc international airport has just shut down because theyre totally iced and theyre sending their incoming flights to dulles increasing the tower staffs workload then the control towers communications systems are crippled by a rogue military unit led by colonel stuart who is a supporter of esperanza stuart and his men are stationed in a nearby church trudeau alerts the staff that all aircraft approaching the dulles sector but not in the dulles landing pattern are to be diverted to an alternate airport the rest of the incoming flights including hollys are to hold at the outer markers trudeau also mentions that the staff may have just bought itself about 2 hours and after that the airplanes that are low on fuel will start falling out of the sky stuart calls the tower and says that esperanzas airplane will be arriving at dulles in 58 minutes and that the airplane is not to be met by anyone and that it will land on a runway of his designation and at the same time he wants a 747 cargo conversion fully fueled placed at his disposal the tower staff has 2 minutes to advise the incoming flights to hold at the outer markers then the staff will be able to receive only as the ability to send out communications to the airplanes will be disabled stuart also says that any attempt to restore the towers systems will result in deadly penalties hollys airplane is one of the 18 airplanes that are circling over the airport running out of fuel and that makes john extremely desperate to stop stuart and esperanza and help the airport restore its communications so the airplanes can safely land that is if hes not slowed down by inept airport police captain carmine lorenzo at dulles international airport john mcclane is waiting for his wife holly to land a while after he arrives at the airport he feels that somethings wrong he follows two men into the luggage room they both try to kill him but he kills one and the other gets away he gets the dead guys fingerprints and faxes them to his friend al powell over in la the mans name was oswald cochrane and he had been officially dead for two years john then realizes that someone is about to screw around with the airport and hes correct colonel stuart a man who got canned by congress as mcclane says it and his team of excommandos have taken control of the airport shutting down the instrument landing system and the runways he then threatens to cause plane crashes unless the plane carrying ramon esperanza from valverde the fictitious country used in commando 1985 lands at a runway of his designation the chief engineer and the airports swat team unsuccessfully try to restore communications with the planes above because of this stuart crashes a plane mcclane must now try to defeat the terrorists and save his wife before her plane and all the other planes run out of fuel a car is being towed away from a restricted parking zone at washington dulles international airport lt john mcclane bruce willis comes running out of the terminal  its his car that is being written up he argues futilely with the airport cop robert costanzo writing the ticket but is interrupted when his beeper goes off mcclane is waiting for his wife holly to arrive from los angeles he heads into the terminal and asks a girl at the information kiosk for directions to the payphones the woman points mcclane toward the payphones and then returns to watching a tv broadcast about snowstorms slamming the east coastthe newscaster then turns over to a field correspondent at escalon airport in the republic of val verde covering the other major developing story the extradition of deposed dictator and general ramon esperanza franco nero who is being extradited to the united states to stand trialas the newscast continues the scene cuts to an airport hotel room we see the rooms occupant retired special forces colonel stuart william sadler practicing martial arts exercises shirtless the reporter on tv notes that two years ago esperanza led his countrys military campaign against communist insurgents financed by the united states but recently several highranking pentagon officials have been charged with violating a congressional ban and supplying him with weapons mounting evidence that esperanza violated the neutrality of neighboring countries also made congress withhold funding which he is accused of replacing by entering the market of drug trafficking at that point stuarts watch goes off and he pulls his coat out of the closet then turns off the tv aiming the remote like a gunfighterin the terminal mcclane finds the payphones his beeper goes off again but he finds that all of the phones are busy forcing him to waitupstairs colonel stuart and his eleven men  baker burke cochrane garber kahn miller mulkey oreilly sheldon shockley and thompson  leave their rooms and march in formation down the hallway to the elevator the camera settles on stuarts face as the doors close on themmcclane finally manages to grab a phone and contacts holly holly informs her husband that her flight will be landing about 30 minutes late mcclane who is staying with hollys parents is careful to avoid telling holly that the car has been towed after holly hangs up she makes some small talk with the elderly woman sitting next to her the woman shows holly her taser which she says is much more effective for selfdefense compared to pepper spray cansas mcclane leaves the payphone area he collides with colonel stuart the two exchange a brief glance mcclane momentarily recognizes stuarts face but cannot remember where he has seen it he shrugs it off and the two men continue on their separate ways stuart does a double take on mcclane as he disappears into the crowdthe scene changes to the exterior of a small rundown church in a snowy field on the edge of the airport a rusted pickup truck is parked by the shed and a sign next to the front door announces that the church is being closed down and is to be converted into a day care center the quiet tranquility of the landscape is disturbed when an airport service van pulls up and parks out front baker and thompson climb out disguised as utility workers wearing orange uniforms visibility vests and hard hats and each of them carrying a tool caseinside the churchs custodian is having an early dinner and watching a newscast on esperanzas extradition when baker knocks on the door the custodian answers and baker says that he and thompson are checking their equipment and need to inspect the conduit box in the churchs backyard although the unsuspecting custodian claims not to know of any utility lines he lets them in as baker and thompson enter a plane takes off from a runway right next to the churchthe custodian leads baker and thompson down the aisle of the church while musing about the impending closure of the church and the news broadcast continues in the background he comments that although the parish will keep on using the structure it wont be the same when it gets converted into a daycare center he points out that hes been with the church for many years and he feels like a piece of him is dying along with the church baker tells the custodian that hes right about that the custodian turns just as baker suddenly draws a suppressed pistol and shoots him as the custodian dies baker holsters his pistol thompson turns off the tv punches a three digit descrambler code into his radio and reports to stuart this is buckwheat the clubhouse is open he and baker then shift pews aside to create a larger space in the middle of the churchin the main terminal the scene shows another tv broadcast on esperanzas extradition from wntw nighttime news reporter samantha coleman reporting from inside the terminal the camera pans to a phone booth where garber stuarts secondincommand is finishing up a radio call with stuart he leaves the phone booth and joins miller and cochrane at the bar garber relays from stuart that everyone else is in position and ready he asks cochrane for a weather report and cochrane who is listening in on a radio broadcast reports flurries all along the virginia coast and a new storm front moving miller and garber grin at the good news garbers grin quickly fades and he instructs them to continue their assignments they synchronize watches and then miller picks up a giftwrapped package and leavesas miller departs he passes mcclane who is sitting a few tables away waiting for hollys plane as he idly smokes a cigarette mcclanes gaze happens to settle on garber and cochrane talking when two airport cops walk into the bar cochrane instinctively removes his earbud and garber slides his package further under the table as if trying to hide it mcclane glances between the cops and the two men realizing that they must not be up to any good then cochrane stands up to leave and mcclane notices what looks like a pistol and shoulder holster under his jacket suspecting something is up he goes over to the two airport cops to ask them to follow cochrane but backs off when he notices that one of them is the guy who just had his car towedas mcclane chases cochrane through the crowded terminal samantha coleman is interviewing two justice department officials then she spots colonel stuart and garber conversing and walking through the crowd on the other side of the terminal garber is informing stuart that someone in personnel has fallen ill and there is a lastminute replacement on hand and asks him about the security at the airport stuart assures him that security is like they figured a joke at this point coleman and her cameraman are suddenly in stuarts face trying to ask him for a few words stuart tells her that she can have two fuck and you and then takes offmcclane follows cochrane and sees him go through a door leading to the luggage handling area he asks an airport baggage handler to unlock the door and call for help and weaves his way through the conveyer belts he finds miller and cochrane appearing to be tampering with equipment mcclane interrupts them and informs them that they are in a restricted area miller claims that they work for the airline unconvinced mcclane asks to see identificationat this point miller and cochrane whip out their pistols and open fire mcclane returns fire with his own pistol but loses it when miller shoots a suitcase that falls onto mcclane and knocks his pistol onto another conveyer he continues the fight against miller with other tools like golf clubs and mace cans in the fight millers twoway radio is knocked away mcclane manages to corner and kill cochrane crushed by a baggage press and electrocuted and tries to chase down miller who manages to get away when airport cops appear and draw their guns on mcclaneup on hollys plane holly is a little dismayed to find that richard thornburg the insensitive reporter from the first die hard movie is sitting in the same row as her possibly in violation of a restraining order she filed against himin the terminal we see cochranes body being zipped up in a body bag mcclane is handed back his pistol and is appalled at the way the press is crawling all over this new story and asks an airport cop to take him up to their bossas night falls on the church kahn and burke are digging with pickaxes in the backyard baker is standing at the door on sentry duty and changed out of his utility worker disguise when miller comes out of the woods by himself having run all the way after escaping from mcclane baker is somewhat crestfallen when miller offhandedly mentions that cochrane is deadinside colonel stuart is marking measurements on a map of the airport with a protractor when miller comes in and shakes snow off his coat miller shaken reports that a cop killed cochrane and he barely got away alive stuart is indifferent learning that cochrane has died more concerned with whether or not miller accomplished his goals and miller says yes stuart points out to him that although the damage is minimal the penalty is severe and he suddenly puts a pistol to millers forehead he slowly pulls on the trigger and miller tenses up expecting to have his head blown offonly for the weapon to click on an empty chamber stuart puts his pistol away but not before warning miller that he wont be seeing an unloaded chamber the next time he hears of a failuremcclane still believing something more serious is about to happen tries to report his suspicions to airport police captain carmine lorenzo dennis franz who refuses to believe him more focused on the number of airport misconduct laws mcclane has violated in his shootout with cochrane and miller and throws him out of his office needing a plan mcclane sees cochranes body on the stretcher and steals some paper from a rental car girl he catches up to the morgue attendants as they are preparing to load the body into the ambulance and takes fingerprints from the right handup in the skies the f16 fighter jets escorting esperanzas plane out of val verde turn away and leave the aircraft as they leave the danger area the pilots converse in spanish estimating a 3 ½ hour flight time to the united states in the back of the plane esperanza asks to have his leg shackles loosened but the guard points out that he is not allowed to do that esperanza praises the guards loyalty and asks him to light his cigarette he then checks his watch and the action shifts back to the church where stuart is overseeing his men as they set up equipment kahn is installing a radar dish in the bell tower while burke uses an acetylene torch to break into the conduit box allowing them to patch into the airports systemsmcclane faxes the fingerprints to powell reginald veljohnson over in los angeles powell agrees to run the prints through various databases to see if any hits come upup in the control tower trudeau fred dalton thompson the airports chief of operations shows chief engineer leslie barnes art evans the weather radar to inform him of a larger storm front coming in from the north barnes decides that to allow him adequate time to plow the runways between landing aircraft he will need to reduce landing frequencies trudeau gives in to barness request and orders the controllers to hail all of their planes and slow them down to avoid having any congestion this will affect all aircraft heading in to dulles including hollys planemcclane gets the prints back from powell and learns that the man he killed was named sgt oswald cochrane an american advisor in honduras powell notes that cochrane evidently faked his death as he was presumed killed two years ago in a helicopter crash and he was involved in a number of black bag operations during his army service as mcclane takes cochranes service record and heads for the tower samantha coleman spots him and tries to speak with him but much like stuart he brushes her offup in the tower trudeau is exasperated he tells barnes and lorenzo that national airport has just been shut down because their runway is iced up meaning dulles will be heavily strained by being forced to accommodate both its own aircraft and nationals flights combined with the bad weather lorenzo is complaining to trudeau about the presss obsession with the dead mercenary and how the story has ended up on the evening newscasts much worse since these reporters were swarming all over the esperanza story he admits that while he would like to eject all of the reporters from the airport he also doesnt want to violate the first amendment or risk the aclu suing them into oblivion at that point mcclane comes in to the tower and gives trudeau the report on cochranes military service despite lorenzos objections trudeau believes mcclanes suspicions that there is a situation going on in the airportin the backyard of the church burke is breaking into the conduit box with a torch he lifts up his face shield and radios to stuart that their systems are ready and they activate their equipment the church we see has been transformed into a miniature version of the control towers infrastructurein the tower mcclane trudeau barnes and lorenzo are startled when suddenly all the runway and taxiway lights begin shutting off the tower erupts in chaos as barnes tries to figure out what is going on and how to resolve the problem and controllers frantically work to get all of their aircraft back into the sky and out of dangerthe henchmen sever cables for the ils and approach control systems and trudeau has to get on the intercom to calm all of the controllers he declares code red and gives specific instructions to what the incoming planes are to do they are to shunt all aircraft to their alternate airports except for those that have started their approaches who are to continue circling the airport including hollys aircraftat this point stuart calls the tower on a phone patched into the utilities he demands a cargoconverted 747 fully fuelled and available within an hour and he will be landing esperanzas aircraft on a runway of his choice though he avoids mentioning esperanza by name stuart makes it clear that he is serious and warns of severe penalties if the airport tries to restore their systems mcclane tries to help but lorenzo ejects him from the tower as well as coleman who has somehow gained access to the toweras they are heading down the elevator mcclane escapes by climbing out the roof hatch coleman tries to ask him for a few words but mcclane tells her fuck off she admits that shes already heard this from colonel stuart mcclane realizes who his adversary is and he continues his escape when the elevator is greeted by two airport cops at the bottom they wonder why coleman is alone and she shrugs admitting that mcclane is claustrophobicup above barnes and his engineers try to figure out how to restore communication with the planes they then realize that a new transmitter in an underconstruction terminal might be functional trudeau and lorenzo converse with barnes who explains that he can get the systems on the under construction annex skywalk up and running within a half hour and the planes wont need to change frequencies to communicate with themdown below we see mcclane making his way through the subterranean basement he is suddenly drawn towards the sound of music playing on a phonograph and finds himself in a small basement apartment he is startled by the appearance of marvin the airport janitor who lives here since hes homeless he gives mcclane directions to the annex skywalk which mcclane realizes is a great location to carry out an ambush to get to the skywalk mcclane first must walk a narrow beam over one of the boilers once across he crawls into a ventilation duct while complaining about how he never gets to have a normal christmasmeanwhile trudeau gives a last message out to the circling planes to request that they circle until they can restore the systems every flight still listed on the departures and arrivals boards has its status changed to delayed much to the frustration of people waiting for arriving passengersbarnes packs up his tool case and a five man swat team comes to escort him to the skywalk as they walk he complains to them that restoring communications with a swat escort wasnt part of his job description though the sergeant promises to watch barness back barnes is not reassuredwhen he gets to the skywalk barnes calls trudeau to report in as he and his escort team make their way down a moving sidewalk at the other end of the sidewalk lying in wait to ambush them are oreilly sheldon shockley and mulkey disguised as painters and maintenance staff oreilly is standing at the end of the moving sidewalk while shockley and mulkey are stationed behind some other equipment lying on the ground and sheldon is stationed on the scaffolding and pretending to paint the ceiling as the swat escorts are nearing the end of the sidewalk oreilly presses the stop button bringing the walkway to a sudden halt and nearly knocking barnes and the five swat officers off their feet the sergeant yells at oreilly who then turns his back to them the team continues walking failing to see mulkey shockley and sheldon drawing submachine gunsas the swat officers come up on oreilly the annoyed officer on point asks him what he looks like oreilly suddenly turns around a pistol in his right hand and a submachine gun in his left and replies a sitting duck he promptly shoots the officer in the face with the pistol then promptly dives for cover as the remaining swat officers raises their rifles and fire at him sheldon shockley and mulkey also open fire as wellas bullets fly barnes jumps over the sidewalk railing and dives for cover he almost gives himself away when flying glass shards slice a nasty gash across his left arm while barnes hunkers down sheldon guns down a swat officer firing a shotgun at him the third officer shoots shockley only for himself and another officer to be shot dead by mulkey the fifth and last officer fires a burst across the sidewalk railing sheldon turns his submachine gun and riddles the officer with bullets even as he tries to draw his backup pistol the officer is thrown backwards through a plate glass pane and falls on his back barnes reaches and successfully grabs his tool casesuddenly the shooting ceases and everything goes silent except for the sound of the heating system barnes suddenly realizes that he is all alone and looks around nervously to see if anyone is hiding to ambush him he fails to see oreilly creeping up behind him barnes doesnt know this until oreilly puts a pistol to his headas oreilly prepares to pull the trigger a ventilation grate over his head suddenly is pushed out oreilly looks up and catches it on reflex mcclane appears and fires his pistol at the disarmed oreilly until his bullets drill straight through the grate and through oreillys body as oreilly crumples dead sheldon and mulkey open fire on mcclane who returns fire during a brief lull mcclane jumps down and barnes uses this distraction to run for his life as mcclane fires on sheldon and mulkeymcclane jumps over oreillys body and dives onto the skywalk firing upwards at sheldon mulkey reloads his submachine gun and fires on mcclane mcclane rolls across the floor while firing at mulkey and is driven underneath sheldons scaffolding mulkey continues firing until his gun jams figuring out where sheldon is mcclane reloads his pistol and begins shooting upwards through several wooden boards sheldon contorts himself to avoid mcclanes bullets as he reloads then fires downwards driving mcclane out into the open mcclane hurriedly pushes the metal scaffolding support which eventually gives way sheldon continues shooting until he falls off the toppling scaffolding he has a split second to scream as the platform lands on him and crushes his neckmcclane fires his pistol at mulkey across the gallery until another part of the scaffolding falls on top of him and knocks his pistol onto the moving sidewalk mulkey sees his enemy immobilized furious he ejects his submachine guns magazine and jumps onto the sidewalk cursing at mcclaneat that point mcclane grabs a piece of fallen metal pipe to start up the moving sidewalk mulkey notices mcclanes pistol lying on the ground just in front of him he sprints towards it hoping to use it to finish his foe off but mcclane reaches grabs it first and empties the remainder of his magazine into mulkey at close range and mulkey crumples deadbarnes then frees mcclane from the scaffolding pinning him down and stops the walkway in its tracks as he prepares to get up to check on the antenna system it suddenly explodes in a giant fireball shattering the windows on the skywalk mcclane and barnes are unharmed being outside the blast radiuson the plane thornburg is trying to take a look out hollys window much to her discomfort and he notices another plane not too far away he insists that he has an obligation to show the world what the people want to know but holly is not above reminding him that he endangered her familyback on the skywalk paramedics are removing the bodies of the swat officers killed by stuarts team and the henchmen killed by mcclane mcclane is bandaging barness arm while barnes is on the phone with trudeau there is a distraction when mcclane hears a garbled noise coming from shockleys body he rolls shockley over and pulls out shockleys radio the source of the garbled radio chatter the noise is garber trying to hail the annex soldiers on the radio because the three digit code hasnt been punched in his voice sounds scrambled garber turns to stuart who looks concerned barnes analyzes the radio determining that with a threedigit descrambler code and over a million possible combinations it would have been easier if one of the men had punched the code in and tried to communicate with stuart before they were shotat the church stuart learns what has happened when kahn comes down from the choir loft after overhearing barness phone call stuart is not happy to find that his annex team has been killed he promptly calls up the tower and declares to the controllers that they will pay the penalty mcclane communicates through barness tiein phone to stuart and is rudely berated by lorenzo who is cut off when he notices from trudeaus look that he has just betrayed mcclanes identity stuart makes clear what he plans to show by rescuing esperanza then hangs uponce he hangs up stuart turns to thompson and asks him to find a flight that is definitely low on fuel and will need priority landing thompson gives him the info slip for windsor airlines flight 114 a douglas dc8 en route from london heathrow airport thompson then resets the ils ground level to 200 feet below real ground level stuart adapts a southern accent and impersonates an approach controller to contact the windsor flight and instructs them to come in for an ils landing on runway 29 mcclane realizes what stuart wants to do and runs over to the window he grabs two pipes a lighter and some rags barnes uses a painters uniform to lower mcclane to the ground and mcclane heads for the runway wearing barness firefighters coat on the plane the pilots start going over their landing checklistsas they pass the outer marker beacon the pilots restart communication with stuart who is using his normal voice to pose as the control tower mcclane lights the rags with his cigarette lighter and uses the pipes as improvised torches and waves frantically to signal to the incoming plane trudeau and lorenzo in the tower spot him out on the runway and realize what mcclane is trying to do though they take concern that he might be endangering himselfas the plane gets into range mcclane signals more frantically but this proves useless as the aircraft flies overhead the pilots panic when they see they are barreling towards the runway at a fasterthannormal descent rate but before they have time to correct the plane slams into the runway with such force that the landing gear collapses sparks produced by the underbelly as it slides down the runway cause the fumes in the ruptured tanks to ignite the plane promptly explodes in a fireball sending debris flying everywhere instantly killing all 230 passengers and crew on board stuart then picks up the phone and coldly informs the tower that future lessons can be averted if the escape plane is available on time and the men in the tower dont interfere with esperanzas aircraftcrash tenders race to the crash site and start a searchandrescue operation but its a fruitless effort we also see mcclane walking through the burning wreckage dazed and in a trance he picks up a girls doll found near the remains of the landing gear in the tower we see a doctor treating the cut barnes received on his arm during the skywalk shootout trudeau comes up to him and orders him to look for a way to warn the planes that are still circling over dulles about the new impending danger trudeau feels mcclanes emotions and informs him that they are summoning a special forces unit to take out stuart and his menstuart watches samantha coleman delivering a tv broadcast on his own plane crash and crumples up the slip with the planes informationthe armys blue light unit headed by major grant john amos arrives on the tarmac in two choppers up in the tower barnes and his engineers try to figure out how to communicate to their planes when one of the engineers mentions that the headwinds are slamming aircraft on the outer marker barnes gets an idea and uses the outer marker beacons frequency to address all circling aircraft he does not know that thornburg is listening in with his radio mike and is writing everything downunfortunately for mcclane the army and doj see him as a civilian and eject him from the briefing on the situation he goes back to marvins basement apartment and asks for a way to the pilots briefing room however he gets something better just then he overhears the beeping of a radio being punched into and overhears a radio communication between stuart and garber mcclane moves a few charts beside to find that marvin has acquired the radio miller had lost during his fight with mcclane in the baggage roomin the church stuart is briefing his henchmen he is interrupted when thompson informs him that esperanzas plane is making contact stuart instructs the tower via phone not to interfere then impersonates the control tower again to make contact with the plane he instructs esperanzas pilots to land the aircraft on a different runway from the one that they have been assigned to land onin preparation for landing esperanza strangles and kills his guard with the chain of his handcuffs then unlocks his leg restraints with the guards key just as the pilot is pointing out that stuart is giving them orders contrary to their instructions esperanza sneaks into the cockpit and puts a pistol to the pilots head and orders him to acknowledge stuarts instructions after a moments hesitation the pilot does so at that point the copilot tries to grab for the gun in the struggle a bullet is discharged which kills the copilot and ricochets blowing out a window and causing a decompression esperanza then puts his pistol to the pilots head reassures him that landing will not be his problem then shoots him he then pulls out one of stuarts special radios from behind the console and makes a mayday call which stuart overhears he redirects esperanza to another runway that will give him a direct approachunknown to stuart or esperanza mcclane has one of their radios and is overhearing their instructions he makes his way to the runway in question and meets esperanzas plane just as he touches down mcclane confronts esperanza but is then ambushed by stuarts henchmen mcclane manages to wound esperanza in the shoulder and also kils thompson mcclane hides in the cockpit and esperanza and kahn use a pipe to barricade the door kahn then shoots up the cockpit door which proves to be bulletproof he helps esperanza off the aircraft and stuart runs over to check on him learning esperanzas story of the mystery cop stuart realizes that its mcclane he and his henchmen then spray up the cockpit in an attempt to give mcclane a military funeral one bullet hits mcclane in his hand the mercenaries then throw hand grenades through the shattered windows of the cockpit mcclane escapes through the pilots ejector seat just before the plane explodes a parachute deploys but stuart and his men are forced to drive off in their suv when they see crash tenders approaching from the terminalmeanwhile the pilots of hollys plane notice that they are running low on fuel and wonder how much longer they will lastgrant and lorenzo are frustrated with mcclane for trying to confront esperanza and stuart by himself pointing out that stuart might crash another plane in retaliation barnes pulls mcclane aside and shows him some airport maps of underground utilities this allows them to determine the possible location of where stuart might be basedmcclane and barnes drive over to a suburban tract neighborhood on the edge of the airport as they finish clearing several houses they find the church they notice baker walking around the back of the church on sentry duty trying to be casual barnes stays back to call lorenzo while mcclane advances to get a closer look unfortunately just as he is getting close to the pickup truck parked out front holly tries calling him from an airphone and his beeper goes off giving mcclanes position away mcclane manages to silence his beeper but it is too late to stop baker from suddenly attacking him the fight continues while inside stuart tells esperanza that the escape plane is being readied as they speak at the same
