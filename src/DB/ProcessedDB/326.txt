given the assignment but no one expects her to succeed in an inhumanly punishing regime that has a standard 60 dropout rate for men however oneill is determined to prove everyone wrong in washington dc a senate hearing is being held the hearing is chaired by a powerful senator lillian dehaven who questions the us militarys policies of women being allowed to serve in combat situations dehaven plans to have a female naval officer enroll in seal training one of the toughest training programs the us military has to offer with a 60 failure rate amongst its candidates she receives much resistance from the naval representatives at the hearing however she uses her influence to put her plan into actionthe candidate dehaven handpicks is lieutenant jordan oneill whom works in naval communications as a satellite specialist oneill has been passed over for promotion within her division with many male coworkers having less experience than she does oneill is also romantically involved with one of her superior officers royce tension arises between herself and royce when she chooses to participate in the training courseoneill reports to the seal training facility and is immediately subject to ridicule and discrimination from her fellow candidates and the bases commanding colonel who makes attempts to treat her delicately because shes a woman the facilitys command master chief cmc john urgayle addresses his candidates for the 1st time by reciting a poem self pity by dh lawrence the trainees are then begin their hell week where they are subjected to extremely rigorous mental and physical conditions they are forced to push heavy ship fenders up sand dunes exercise in cold water hold heavy rafts over their heads for prolonged periods of time and are constantly ridiculed by urgayles staff when the training regimen becomes too much for a candidate they have the option of leaving the program voluntarily by ringing a ceremonial bell three timeshell week ends for the candidates when they are required to run a difficult obstacle course under live fire oneill is told that there will be a small set of wooden steps at a wall marking the end of the course to make it easier for her to scale the wall the trainees including oneill make it to the wall oneill pushes the step unit aside and volunteers her own body to allow her fellow trainees to get over the wall the last trainee cortez reaches his hand down to help oneill but keeps his grip just out of reach and then suggests she quit oneill uses the stair unit to scale the wall and runs to join her comrades but misses a tripwire signifying she may have killed some or all of the company later when urgayles staff reads of the candidates times oneill finds to her surprise she passed the course even though she came in dead last behind other candidates who didnt finish in the required 12 minute limit shes told that she was given a 30 second buffer a concept they refer to as gender norming oneill meets directly with the bases colonel who never happy about the idea of a woman being allowed into seal training tells her that hed altered the program because shes a woman oneill requests that she be treated the same as the male candidates including being allowed to take up residence in their barracks her request is granted and she reports to the bases barber shop the barber isnt there and she shaves off her long hair herself and joins the men in their barracks after a brief argument with one of the other candidates urgayle orders the ranking officer wickwire to rewrite the schedule to allow oneill privacy in the head and showerback in washington oneills success in hell week is reported to dehaven it is revealed that dehaven has also been generating publicity about oneills candidacy but she has an ulterior motive she is using the incident as leverage to prevent the closing of military bases in her native texas but voting for base closings in other statesoneill continues through the rest of the program learning how to use weapons field strip and reassemble them and learns the effects of forced drowning from interrogation she manages to score higher than most of her male counterparts and slowly begins earning the respect of more of her comrades during an exercise where they are extracted from the water by highspeed boats oneill fails to pull herself from the water urgayle lectures her later about her failure in the test and tells her he earned the navy cross for pulling a man much larger than himself from a burning tank he worries that oneill may not be able to perform a similar task under combat conditions he also tells her that shell be taking over a squadthe trainees then enter a very crucial stage of the program called sere they will be placed into a simulated combat mission where they very likely be captured and subjected to harsh interrogation and physical abuse the teams are dropped off at the coast of captiva island and under oneills direction make their way inland until they find what appears to be a deserted compound while they perform their reconnaissance procedures part of oneills team cortez and slovnick break off and try to retrieve a helmet for a souvenir the helmet is shot off its perch by a sniper and a net traps them both oneill and the rest of her team try to retreat into the forest and are quickly capturedtheir captors turn out to be urgayle his assistant pyro and the rest of their training instructors the ranking officers including oneill are thrown into confined wooden boxes and taken one at a time into the main shack to be interrogated when oneill is taken in urgayle preys upon his perceived notion of oneills weakness  her ability to carry out one of her team who was injured in their attempted escape urgayle then begins to beat oneill viciously under the pretense of the treatment shed receive if she were really captured by an actual hostile urgayle drags oneill outside and shoves her head in a trough of muddy water demanding that the other prisoners reveal intelligence about the rest of the seal team in the forest urgayle then threatens to rape oneill in front of the company oneill her hands bound behind her kicks urgayle in the crotch and slams her skull into his face breaking his nose she then kicks him further urgayle gets to his feet and beats oneill down he staggers to the prisoner corral and tries to convince the male members of the team that oneill is a weak link that could get them all killed oneill having regained her feet suddenly shouts suck my dick to urgayle the rest of the team rallies behind her and urgayle gives up defeatedafter returning from sere training the team with new found respect and admiration for oneills tough nature and courage treat her to a drink shortly after oneill is called into the colonels office and presented with pictures of her hanging out with female officers suspected of being lesbians oneill is told shell be sent back to washington and will take up a desk job until the matter is investigated if oneill wishes to complete the seal program shell have to start over again furious at the false charges oneill rings out of the seal program and drives back to washington she goes to the home shed been sharing with royce royce shows her evidence from dehavens office showing that the senator had sent a memo to the navy about the dangers of letting a woman complete seal training and that us citizens arent ready for women to enter combat oneill goes to a senate committee hearing concerning the closing of military bases and confronts dehaven openly accusing dehaven of deliberately sinking her career for her own gain dehaven says shes actually amazed that oneill had gotten as far as she did in the training program and that her approval of oneills enlistment was a publicity stunt oneill threatens to take dehavens actions regarding military base closings to the news units just outside the hearing room and dehaven promises to get oneill back into the seal program and does oneill returns to her unitthe last phase of training is to be conducted somewhere in the mediterranean sea while awaiting orders aboard a submarine an emergency mission comes up and urgayles team is ordered to participate a us satellite had come down in libya and the us army ranger team sent in to retrieve it needs assistance the plutonium in the satellite is weapons grade according to oneill and could easily fall into enemy possession after landing on the beach oneill  urgayle split from the rest of the team and reconnoiter a nearby libyan camp when a libyan border patrol party shows up unexpectedly oneill hides while being covered by urgayle they quickly determine that the ranger team could be discovered when one of the party gets too close to oneills hiding spot urgayle shoots him drawing the attention of the the mans comrades oneill and urgayle retreat oneill making it safely back to the beach surmising that the chief wouldnt draw the libyans back to the rallying point for both the satellite recovery unit and the seal team she identifies another location that the chief would more likely retreat to the team sets up an ambush there with a minefield and the chief shows up during a furious firefight urgayle is wounded and oneill rushes into the minefield and drags the chief out the mines are detonated and the team escapesback at the seal training facility the successful graduates receive their pins for completing the training from urgayle oneill goes to empty her locker and finds a copy of dh lawrences poetry
