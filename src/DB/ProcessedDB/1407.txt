she throws the dress she was wearing while with him in the trash and mopes around the house the rest of the evening in nothing but her panties this also does not advance the plot in any way but helps us get to know mayafter quick dispatches the two henchmen in separate incidents the second involving a bomb with an led screen that displays bye bye before it explodes joe leon convinces his friend the chief of police that the police need trents explosives expertise to help solve the case the chief arranges for trent to work with the bomb squad in order to impress and intimidate his new
