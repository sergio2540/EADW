conway is a writer humanitarian diplomat and former military man all of which have made him a public hero but he is remarkably unfulfilled in his life something he does not tell anyone on march 10

secretary he is able to complete the evacuation with him his overly pragmatic brother george conway paleontologist alexander lovett a fussbudget of a man secretive henry barnard who later states why he is so secretive about himself and terminally ill american gloria stone his fellow passengers on the last flight out what they are initially unaware of is that the plane has been hijacked and eventually crash lands high in the himalayas killing the hijacking pilot but instead of what seems a probable death for them they are rescued by a band of men who take them back to their community hidden behind the mountains a seemingly utopian community named shangrila where the overall belief is to be kind aging is also a seemingly unknown concept each of the five has different feelings about their new sanctuary where they eventually learn they were not brought by accident on one end of the spectrum is george who does whatever he can to get back to civilization as he knows it despite the probable hardship of doing so especially since there is no means of communication in and out he believes what they have been told are all lies and that they are being held prisoners against their will on the other end is bob who believes that shangrila is exactly what hes been looking for in life with no proof one way or another the five have differing views of staying in shangrila forever or trying to make their way out it may be not until they receive that proof that a definitive decision can be made but by that time it may be too late for some on 10 march 1935 the pacifist british diplomat and future foreign secretary robert conway helps a group of ninety westerns white people to escape from the chinese city of baskul after the beginning of a revolution he leaves the airport in the last plane with his brother george the geologist alexander p lovett the rogue trader henry barnard and the sick and bitter gloria stone however the plane is skyjacked and crashes in a remote area in tibet when they have no further hope of surviving they are rescued and brought to the utopistic paradise shangrila a peaceful and plentiful place without illness war or any type of dispute their first sensation is that they are prisoners but along the days each survivor loves and has no intention to leave the place except george that tries to convince the group to leave shangrila
