years later derice bannock son to a former friend of irv fails to qualify for the 100yard sprint for the olympics due to a stupid accident but when he hears of irving blitzer living also on jamaica derice decides to go to the games anyway if not as a sprinter then as a bobsledder after some starting problems the first jamaican bobsledding team is formed and heads for calgary in the freezing weather derice sanka junior and yul are only laughed at since nobody can take a jamaican bobsledding team led by a disgraced trainer seriously but team spirit and a healthy self confidence may lead to a few surprises in the upcoming winter games when the jamaican sprinter derice bannock is disqualified to the olympic games due to a silly accident he envisions the chance to participate in bobsleigh modality he meets the dishonored coach irving blitzer who is living in the tropical country after two gold medals and elimination due to cheating and convinces him to coach the first jamaican bobsled

everyones amusementlater that day sanka joins derices family at the track for the olympic trials derice is preparing to race meeting a few other competitors including a short athlete named junior bevil rawle d lewis the race starts off great but halfway across the track junior stumbles and trips several runners including derice derice stumbles back to his feet as the finishline tape is broken watching his dreams go up in smokederice confronts coolidge winston stona who is charge of the jamaican competition and begs for a chance to run again but coolidge refuses derice then notices a photo of his father on his wall next to an unfamiliar man coolidge identifies the man as irving blitzer an american now living on the island and who had tried to convince derices father ben to compete in bobsledding derice seeing another chance to compete as a bobsledder takes the picture and goes to meet with irvsanka hears about derices idea at first he is excited but balks upon learning that bobsledding is a winter sport eventually sanka is persuaded to help his best friend the two men find blitzer john candy working as a bookie in a rundown pool hall having been disqualified from bobsledding due to cheating and therefore disgraced blitzer is far from eager to help them and does not want anything to do with the sport of bobsledding however the two athletes dont give up upon learning that derice is the son of his old friend and colleague blitzer relentsnext day blitzer tries to recruit additional team members the first newcomer is a bald man sanka recognizes from the olympic running trials who introduces himself as yul brenner malik yoba and is more than willing to compete in bobsledding so long as it leads him to the olympics only one other man shows up to join the team junior the clumsy runner from the track having been one of the other runners tripped up by juniors fall yul is immediately hostile to junior but relents since without junior they dont have a full teamblitzer begins training the four immediately he builds a makeshift bobsled and has them push it down a steep slope telling the team that if they cant get a pushstart completed in under 6 seconds they wont have a chance at competing yul is the second mlddle man junior is first middle man blitzer chooses sanka as brakes but sanka resists he reminds him that the driver in bobsledding has many more responsiblities than a push car racer and cant go out to have fun with his teammates sanka relents and decides derice can be driverafter the first day of training junior returns home with the intention of telling his father about the team but mr bevil charles hyatt comes home and tells junior that he has gotten his son a job with a brokerage house in miami which he is expected to take by the end of the month intimidated junior clams up and cannot say anything moreinitially the training does not go well the group stumbles and falls several times not even able to get into the sled but after several tries they climb in together and rocket down the mountain eventually crashing into a police car blitzer runs after them cheering they got started in 59 seconds he tells them to bring the sled back up the mountain making them groannow that the team is in good shape blitzer goes to coolidge to ask for funding to get to the olympics but coolidge refuses believing that the team will be humiliated unshaken derice decides they will try to get the money elsewhere after several fundraising endeavors they are far short of their goal junior comes back to the team after a day away announcing that he has sold his car to get the required funds derice does not want to take the money from junior at first thinking it to be exploiting junior but junior explains that he still feels guilty for costing derice and the others their first olympic chance and gladly gives up the moneythe team heads to calgary for the olympic games while blitzer adjusts to the weather easily the jamaicans are unprepared for the severe cold and buy heavyduty coats as soon as the plane landsblitzer registers the team for competition and meets a few colleagues from his days in bobsledding he has lunch with one friend roger paul coeur and asks him for a sled so his team can compete roger is reluctant but agrees to sell off an old backup sled from the us teamthe team begins learning how to move and walk on ice using a hockey rink for practice it does not go well at first but they eventually make progress that night derice watches the swiss bobsled team practicing and becomes enamored with their efficient performanceblitzer shows off the sled he purchased to the team its is rusted and old but still works fineon their first day at the track the jamaican team is met with ridicule and scorn by other competitors blitzer tells them that a pushstart will not be necessary for the initial run they will just be nudged down the slide instead while the run starts off fine the sled ends up crashing before the finish line their next run does not go well either they end up chasing the sled down the track a photographer snaps a picture of the group running after the sled and it makes the papers which doesnt sit in well with mr bevil and coolidgederice is repairing the sled when he meets one of irvs old colleagues who tells derice that during the1972 competition irv hid weights at the bottom of his sled to accelerate its speed as a result he was kicked out and had his gold medals revokedthe following night at the hotel sanka tries to pose as a maid but yul brushes him aside thinking hes insane junior receives a telegram from his father the news story about the jamaican team alerted mr bevil to juniors activities and he is now ordering his son homewhile they are out in a bar that night yul encourages junior to stand up for himself junior immediately responds by confronting the german team members who had insulted them earlier resulting in a huge barfight between yul sanka junior and the germansat the relax inn motel derice berates his teammates for what happened and tells them the swiss team would never resort to stunts like that because theyre awlays focused on their performance yul sanka and junior dont take derice seriously and continue snickering sanka makes a crude joke about the swiss team and what happens if they try to push a pretty girl off the ice a few minutes later irv comes in and berates the three for not taking things seriously he reminds them that everyone hates them and they need to get their act togetherafter thinking things over the jamaicans resume serious training with irvs help they are quickly whipped back into shapefinally the night of the jamaican teams qualifying run has arrived irv presents the team with special competition suits as a reward for their improved behavior irv then meets with the three judges who remind him that the team must make it off the slope and across the finish line in under 1 minute in order to be eligible the team sets out and despite a few bumps they cross the finish line safely after several tense moments their time is revealed 5946 irv and the team are overjoyedthe guys celebrate by painting their sled with jamaicas colors and derice decides to christen the sled cool runnings at that moment irv gets a letter from the judges informing him that the jamaican team has been disqualifiedirv angirlly storms into the offices of the men in charge demanding to know why apparently there is a rule stating that a team must compete in an international race to qualify previously an olympic trial would be considered an international race but this time the committee decided to change the rules however irv isnt fooled and immediately discerns the truth his former coach from the 72 games and currently a primary judge of the 88 games kurt hemphill is still punishing him for embarrassing the usa by cheating irv confronts hemphill and confesses that 16 years previously hed made the mistake of his life he resorted to cheating because he wanted to win and didnt care what the consequences were instead he ended up disgracing the americans by embarrassing everyone  his coach teammates friends and family  and his gold medals were revoked as a result irv also reminds kurt that it was his mistake and if kurt wants revenge he should punish him not the jamacian bobsledding team as they deserve to represent their country by competing in the winter games as contenders and dont deserve to suffer because of his past mistakes that night at their hotel the team gets a phone call informing them that the committee has reversed its decision  the jamaicans are back ineveryone on the island of jamaica watches the bobsled team wave their flag as they enter the olympic stadium after the opening ceremony irv tries to find some inspirational words for the team but this conversation is cut short by the arrival of mr bevil who has come to collect his son bevil tells junior that he is only looking out for his sons best interest and demands the young man gather his things but junior draws on yuls advice and stands up to his father telling him hes staying with his team and that his father cares about his own interest in making himself look good more than his sons junior tells him hes an olymic athlete now not his puppet and sends his father on his wayon the first day of competition the jamaican team is scheduled to compete last derice tries to psyche up his team imitating the behavior of the swiss the team begins its run essentially stumbling down the track and bouncing off the edges their end run time is 5804 landing them in last placederice again tries to imitate the swiss but the team is fed up with his antics sanka sets him straight by pointing out that they cannot copy the movements of another team they must get their own style derice insists that he just wants to be the best they can be sanka counters that the best they can be is jamaican and that they didnt come all this way to forget about their heritage derice relents after realizing that his friend and their teammates are righton the second day of

tells him to focus on tomorrowthe last day of competition arrives and the fans are eager to see jamaicas performance they start off with an even better formation than yesterday but the ancient sled is
