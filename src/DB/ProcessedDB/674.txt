where they find a cage chains and parts of several bodies a check on paul gallier shows that hes been in and out of mental institutions since the age of 10 when his parents killed themselves they were circus
performers and paul grew up around big cats thinking that paul might have been the one keeping the escaped panther they call the zoo oliver and alice come over it is the policemans opinion that paul meant to kill irena so he suggests that she find someplace else to live oliver offers her a place to stay with himirena is becoming more and more troubled as if the stuff with paul wasnt bad enough one night she finds herself running on all fours after a rabbit its also becoming apparent to her that she is falling in love with oliver and he with her but she tells him that she cannot make love to him alice is also in love with oliver and this is evoking feelings of rivalry in irenaa week goes by and the search for the escaped panther has proven fruitless in the meantime paul has murdered another girl he feels that he can no longer go on like this he crashes through irenas bedroom
window one night and once more tries to have sex with her its the only way they can live he explains just as their parents who were also brother and sister lived together as husband and wife irena refuses and
stabs him with a piece of broken window glass paul turns into a panther when oliver comes home alice in tow he is attacked by the panther alice gets the shotgun and shoots it dead when oliver autopsies the panther he is horrified to see a human hand in its stomach after which the entire panther spontaneously disintegratesthe next morning alice is out jogging its getting late and she stops at the gym for a quick swim and change of clothes as she is getting undressed she hears a growl afraid alice jumps into the pool suddenly the lights go out and the growling gets louder alice begins to scream when the lights are turned back on irena is standing there the receptionist hands alice her robe only to find that it is torn into shredsalice calls oliver to warn him of her experience but oliver is too charmed by irena who has just returned and is taking off her clothes letting him know that she is ready to make love afterwards she turns into a panther but she leaves before she can harm oliver she is spotted near the bridge swat teams have been called to corner the panther oliver and alice arrive despite this presence the panther gets awayoliver goes looking for irena he finds her in human form because she has killed irena begs oliver to kill her oliver refuses so irena asks him to free her by making love once more i want to live with my own
