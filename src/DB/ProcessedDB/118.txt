before leaving she tells jo that she needs to succeed to make sure what happened to wakita doesnt happen again dusty listens to the radio hearing that meteorologists are predicting rare f5 tornadoes jo comes up with a way to make dorothy work while watching some wind chimes she has bills team fabricate pinwheels out of aluminum cans and attaches them to the sensors with screws to make them flya few hours later as dawn begins to break bill and jo come alongside a huge milewide f5 tornado in the countryside they put dorothy 3 on the road in front of the tornado and then back up but the winds push dorothy around and then a tree knocks dorothy 3 over scattering the sensors the storm turns toward bill and jo and they attempt to drive away they become stuck when a tree wedges underneath the back end of their truck a tanker fuel truck is pushed along the road toward their truck by the tornado and knocks them free before exploding bill drives around the wreckage through the fireball narrowly avoiding catastrophe bill drives ahead of the tornado dodging as it drops farm vehicles on the road in front of him they end up driving through a small house that is rolled by the tornado onto the roadas bill and jo drive away jonas and eddie ride to intercept the tornado and place their dot 3 pack jo and bill noticing that jonas is driving too close to the tornado warn him to change course but he ignores them eddie wants to heed bills warning but jonas orders him to keep driving the tornado hurls a section of a tv tower through their windshield impaling eddie both teams watch in horror as jonass truck is lifted up by the tornado and thrown into the ground where it explodes killing both eddie and jonasbill and jo then conclude there is one last option left they head toward a new intercept point turn on dorothy 4 without releasing it from its moorings on the truckbed and then drive the truck straight at the tornado with the truck on cruise control they jump out letting it drive into the center of the tornado where it successfully deploys dorothy 4the team starts to celebrate as the dorothy sensors work analyzing the inside of the tornado but then notice the tornado shifting bill and jo notice it as well and flee to a nearby farm they first take cover in a barn but it is filled with sharp metal tools it destroys the barn and they dodge debris as they run to take cover in a small outbuilding they find metal pipes inside this shelter and tie themselves to the pipes with leather belts the tornado destroys the structure and they are pulled upside down while anchored to the pipes they manage to see the inside of the f5 tornado as it passes over them it is filled with lighting and a smaller tornado in the core seconds later the entire storm dissipates and the family from the farm comes out of their underground storm shelter and observe their damaged farm bill and jo debate who will run the lab and who will analyze the new data from dorothy while the
