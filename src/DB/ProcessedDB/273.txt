the armored car and crumples dead five bullets across his right arm and chest cheritto holds his rifle on the last guard looking to neil with approval with a nod from neil cheritto aims his rifle at the guard and shoots him twice in the chest he then steps forward and shoots the guard again in the head at pointblank range they then run back to the ambulance removing their masks as trejo drivesas the crew speeds away from the scene the first police cars come speeding towards the scene from the other direction the first three units are unable to see the spike strip in time blow out their tires

neil and his crew pile out of the ambulance a few blocks away and climb into a station wagon parked there shiherlis plants a firebomb in the back of the ambulance that destroys their weapons and gear as they drive awaythat evening neil meets in a parking garage with nate jon voight his moneylaundering expert nate tells neil that the envelope they stole contains hundreds of millions in bearer bonds from a company called malibu equity  investments owned by a crooked entrepreneur named roger van zant william fichtner nate agrees to set up a meeting where van zant will send someone with cash to exchange for the bonds nate tells neil of another job offered by a man named kelso that will bring in at least 10 million neil agrees to meet with kelso tom noonan nate also asks neil what went wrong with the heist but neil refuses to talk about itat the scene of the heist hanna arrives and begins investigating with hanna are detective casals wes studi and detective bosko ted levine the trucks used in the job have all been identified but there are no leads hanna is able to recount the heist itself quite accurately noting that those who committed it are definitely professionals he orders his team to begin talking to their informantsat a truck stop diner in a different part of town the rest of the crew and waingro wait for neil who shows up he tells them all that waingro has forfeited his share of the heist and he beats him briefly in full view of the other diners neil is nervous because of the killings of the three guards which will warrant a deeper investigation of homicide by the lapd as they all leave neil suddenly beats waingro and throws him to the pavement with the intention of killing him he is about to shoot waingro with his pistol when cheritto yells for him to stop he has spotted a police car over on the street they watch nervously hoping the police officers havent noticed them there is a sigh of relief when the police car suddenly activates its lights and siren makes a uturn and drives away when neil looks back waingro has vanished he and the others search the truck stop but find no sign of himthe next morning hanna and his partner sgt drucker mykelti williamson burst into the chop shop of albert torena ricky harris one of hannas informants albert tells hanna that his brother richard will meet with neil at a club in koreatown at 2 amneil sets up

torena has told him to go to and talks to richard who tells him that he was incarcerated with a man whom he saw outside prison recently who pulls off large heists getting cherittos name vincent hanna deduces that cheritto is working with neilneil is seen sitting in his car at the drivein theater when a pickup truck arrives driven by van zants drop man neil orders the driver to hold his hands up to prove that he is not holding any weapons and then instructs the man toss the package with his right hand into neils shotgun seat unbeknownst to neil another man armed with a machine pistol is hiding in the back of the pickup and preparing to kill himas the assassin creeps up to the passengers side window of neils car and aims his gun shiherlis armed with a rifle and stationed on the rooftop of the projection building spots him and gives neil a warning through his headset the next moments happen in an instant neil looks in his rearview mirror sees the assassin and instantly floors the car in reverse crushing the assassins foot shiherlis rolls over once aims his rifle and fires at the pickup truck bullets hit the windshield splintering it and the truck pulls forward the assassin struggling to regain his footing fires a wild burst at neils car and neil fires back through his windshield with his pistol now with a clean opening shiherlis draws a bead on the assassin and fires the bullet hits the assassin in the back and spins him around at which point neil fires another round that hits him in the chest before his car runs over the assassin killing him just as the driver is about to reach the exit cheritto steps out from behind the fence and empties a shotgun into the truck killing the driver the now driverless and bulletriddled truck rolls to a stop against the berm as they leave neil examines the package and finds nothing but scrap paper neil later calls van zant and tells him to forget about the payment and threatens to kill himwhat neil shiherlis and cheritto do not realize is that in this time waingro has started to work for van zant nor do they know that the guard waingro killed in the armored car robbery is not waingros first victim he is a serial killer who bashes in young prostitutes heads we watch waingro commit one of these murders later while at a party with his fellow detectives hanna is called away to a motel where one of waingros victims has been found stuffed into a garbage can by a pool hanna is somewhat exasperated upon learning that the dead girls family has shown upneil and his men begin to pull another heist on a precious metals repository cheritto deactivates the alarm system and shiherlis begins to crack a safe inside while neil himself stands guard out front watching for trouble nearby hidden in moving vans hanna his detectives and a swat team observe the scene watching neil stand guard on infrared monitoring equipment while they watch one of the swat team members in hannas van sits down banging the barrel of his rifle against the wall of the truck neil standing watch outside hears the noise he looks right in the direction of the police surveillance trucks highly suspicious he quickly enters the repository and orders shiherlis and cheritto to withdraw to shiherlis chagrin the three men leave emptyhanded and hanna orders the swat officers on the stakeout to let the crew go as he knows that simple breakingandentering would carry a shorter sentence than outright theft woulda short time later vincent and his team observe neil cheritto and shiherlis seemingly casing another job near a shipyard when neil and his guys leave vincent and his men go to the scene and try to figure out what neils next heist will be they determine that theres nothing worth stealing from any of the businesses in the immediate area suddenly hanna has an epiphany he realizes that the casing was a ruse to lure himself and his crew out in the open neil from a high vantage point on a cargo crane takes pictures of the detectives with a highpowered camera with the pictures neil is able through nate to identify hanna and his men when neil meets with nate to pick up the schematics for the bank heist nate tells him about vincent who has a long and successful history of taking down major criminals and that vincent admires neil neil decides that the heist is still worth the riskthe film culminates in a scene where where vincent pulls neil over seemingly on a routine traffic violation he invites neil to join him at a nearby restaurant where they both reflect on their own personal lives during their meeting hanna says that while he may not like it he will kill mccauley if need be to prevent the latter from killing an innocent mccauley points out the flip side by saying that he will not hesitate to kill if the cops box him in mccauley also explains the purpose of his 30 seconds creed by saying he never wants to go back to prisonthe bestlaid plans of the thieves for the bank heist are being secretly thwarted behind the scenes by waingro waingro has been laying low since neils attempt on his life at the truck stop he eventually meets van zant after looking for criminal work in a biker bar after one of his prostitute killings waingro leads van zant to trejo who calls neil and tells him that the police are following him neil tells trejo to head in the opposite direction to throw the police off them when neil receives the call he shiherlis and cheritto are eating at a local diner neil has just spotted an old prison friend of his behind the grill  an excon named donald breedan dennis haysbert who is currently frustrated with his job as a shortorder cook especially since the manager is a jerk who treats him like dirt neil approaches breedan and offers to give him the job of getaway driver as a lastminute substitute for trejo given how much he hates his boss breedan simply cannot refuse neils offerwith his wife being beaten and raped by waingro and van zants crew trejo is forced to reveal

at a tellers deskcheritto gives a small cough signaling for him and neil to slip on their ski masks at that point shiherlis sets down a briefcase at the tellers desk then suddenly whirls around and punches the guard closest to him and tackles him to the floor simultaneously neil and cheritto whip out assault rifles order everyone in the bank to get on the floor and disarm the other guards by binding their hands behind their backs with zip ties and then removing their service weapons neil stands atop a desk and informs the customers that they are not going to be hurt and they wont lose a dime because their money is insured by the federal government he then punches the bank manager in the jaw grabs the mans key and hands it to shiherlis while neil and cheritto guard the lobby shiherlis unlocks the double doors to the vault unloads a set of empty gym bags and loads several piles of money sheets  the money sheets are packed so tightly that shiherlis has to cut the wrapping open with a
