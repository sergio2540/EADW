showwriting couple they want tony to star in a brandnew stage musical theyve just completed and they know who they want to direct it acclaimed actordirector jeffery cordova jack buchanan who currently has five shows running on broadway including oedipus rex which hes starring in himself tony whos never heard of cordova listens politely as they stroll along 42nd street which tony barely recognizes after all these years he sends the martons ahead to dinner in a taxi so he can spend some quality time in an arcade song a shine on your shoesthe martons take tony to oedipus rex where they watch from the wings tony has trouble believing the star and director of such a serious work would want to do a musical tony meets cordova whos a little slow to recognize him but then expresses great excitement at the prospect of working with him tony asks cordova if hes truly interested in producing a musical cordova insists all theatrical genres are valuablethe martons pitch the idea of their light frothy musical tony would play an author of childrens books who feels hes compromised himself artistically by writing lurid yet lucrative murder mysteries on the side lily says his success makes him feel as though hes sort of sold his soul to the devil jeffrey seizes upon that phrase to offer his vision of what the musical should be a modern retelling of faust with himself playing the devil in the guise of a book publisher lily les and tony are taken aback tony doesnt think it will be his kind of musical but jeffrey tells him the show will make him a star all over again as for tonys insistence that hes just an entertainer jeffrey replies that theyre all entertainers song thats entertainment cordova sets about lining up financial backers for the play he also knows who he wants as the leading lady a rising ballet star named gabrielle gerard cyd charisse even though its well known that her mentor and boyfriend paul byrd james mitchell wont let her do a broadway show cordova solves that problem by offering paul the job of choreographing the musical and finagling paul into demanding that gabrielle costar or he wont do it tony who goes with the martons to see gabrielle perform thinks shes fabulous but is apprehensive about starring opposite a classically trained  and noticeably tall  ballerina as it turns out gabrielle is nervous about working with a hollywood legend like tony their initial meeting goes badly amid mutual misunderstandings but by this time the investors are totally sold on the concept and its too late to back outwork begins on the musical to be called the band wagon tony feels out of his element and worse that hes being patronized by jeffrey paul and gabrielle he finally storms out of rehearsal lily and les are concerned about their friend but end up getting into their own argument with les accusing lily of being overly enthralled by jeffrey the martons continue to work on the show  but refuse to talk directly to each othertony throws a temper tantrum in his hotel room gabrielle shows up tony tries to apologize but she lets slip that paul ordered her to apologize to him they start to bicker again gabrielle bursts into tears saying she knows tony never wanted her in the show which a startled tony denies for his part tony confesses how scared hes been of this projectsetting aside their differences tony and gabrielle decide to find out if they really can dance together they go for an evening carriage ride in central park chatting and getting to know each other better alighting from the carriage they stroll past a party of dancing couples and reach a clearing where theyre alone and there they find they can in fact dance together beautifully song dancing in the darkfrantic preparations begin for the shows tryout in new haven connecticut its an incredibly complicated production with a plethora of elaborate sets when it comes time to rehearse the first act finale it seems to go smoothly at first but quickly degenerates into a farce with different parts of the set moving up and down in the wrong directions the pyrotechicsladen damnation scene song you and the night and the music fares little betterthe muchanticipated new haven premiere lays a huge egg complete with onscreen visual metaphor tony shows up for the postpremiere party at a hotel ballroom but none of the financial backers or other cast members is there tony finds the chorus holding a partywake in one of their rooms complete with pizza beer ham and deviled egg they warmly greet tony who regales them with stories of his early show business career theyre soon joined by gabrielle as well as lily and les whove patched things up clowning around tony lily and les perform a comical number song i love louisa which cheers everyone up at first but the mood turns somber over their failed production tony makes a decision he tries calling jeffrey to tell them theyre going ahead with the show only theyre going to return to the martons original script and songs the person on the other end turns out to be a cleaning woman but it doesnt matter because jeffrey entered the room without anyone noticing and has overheard tonys little speech jeffrey admits his approach was wrong and asks to be a part of the revamped band wagon gabrielle also insists on staying with the show even though paul who showed up with jeffrey demands she withdraw she watches sadly as paul walks outwith tony effectively in charge the show travels to philadelphia boston washington dc and baltimore along the way the company polishes a series of musical numbers songs new sun in the sky i guess ill have to change my plan louisiana hayride triplets during the train ride from washington to baltimore tony confesses to les in private that hes fallen in love with gabrielleopening night on broadway its raining as tony and gabrielle arrive at the theater and wish each other luck tony awkwardly tries to express his feelings for gabrielle but thinks the better of it in addition to the other musical numbers the shows pièce de résistance is a spoof of hardboiled detective novels called girl hunt in which tony plays private eye rod riley gabrielle plays two roles that of an anguished blonde scared as a turkey in november and a sinister brunette she came at me in sections more curves than a scenic railwaythe band wagon proves a hit afterward tony in his dressing room is puzzled by how quiet things are after a successful opening but tells his valet hes going out to a nightclub to celebrate even if hes alone reprise by myself as he exits his dressing room tony is startled to find the entire company waiting for him onstage with a surprise party prepared in his honor everyone sings for hes a jolly good fellow gabrielle speaking for everyone tells tony what he means to them  but she also conveys that shes now in love with tony having broken up with paul gabrielle meaningfully concludes the shows going to run a long time and as far as im concerned its going to run forever an overjoyed tony kisses gabrielle they then join jeffrey lily les and the company for a reprise of thats entertainment as the movie ends 7.6movie-star choreographer
