the night had brought little relief from the heat and at dawn a hot gust of
wind blows across the colorless sea the knight antonius block lies
prostrate on some spruce branches spread over the fine sand his eyes are wideopen and bloodshot from lack of sleepnearby his squire jons is snoring loudly he has fallen asleep where he collapsed at the edge of the forest among the windgnarled fir trees his open mouth gapes towards the dawn and unearthly sounds come from his throat
at the sudden gust of wind the horses stir stretching their parched muzzles towards the sea they are as thin and worn as their mastersthe knight has risen and waded into the shallow water where he rinses his sunburned face and blistered lips jons rolls over to face the forest and the darkness he moans in his sleep and vigorously scratches the stubbled hair on his head a scar stretches diagonally across his scalp as white as lightning against the grimethe knight returns to the beach and falls on his knees with his eyes closed and brow furrowed he says his morning prayers his hands are clenched together and his lips form the words silently his face is sad and bitter he opens his eyes and stares directly into the morning sun which wallows up from the misty sea like some bloated dying fish the sky is gray and immobile a dome of lead a cloud hangs mute and dark over the western horizon high up barely visible a seagull floats on motionless wings its cry is weird and restless the knights large gray horse lifts its head and whinnies antonius block turns aroundbehind him stands a man in black his face is very pale and he keeps his hands hidden in the wide folds of his cloakknight who are youdeath i am deathknight have you come for medeath i have been walking by your side for a long timeknight that i knowdeath are you preparedknight

between a strumpets legs to lie is the life for which i sighhe stops and looks at his master but the knight hasnt heard jons song or he pretends that he hasnt to give further vent to his irritation jons sings even louderjons sings
up above is god almighty so very far away but your brother the devil you will meet on every leveljons finally gets the knights attention he stops singing the knight his horse jonss own horse and jons himself know all the songs by heart the long dusty journey from the holy land hasnt made them any cleaner they ride across a mossy heath which stretches towards the horizon beyond it the sea lies shimmering in the white glitter of the sunjons in frjestad everyone was talking about evil omens and other horrible things two horses had eaten each other in the night and in the churchyard graves had been opened and the remains of corpses scattered all over the place yesterday afternoon there were as many as four suns in the heavens
the knight doesnt answer close by a scrawny dog is whining crawling towards its master who is sleeping in a sitting position in the blazing hot sun a black cloud of flies clusters around his head and shoulders the miserablelooking dog whines incessantly as it lies flat on its stomach wagging its tailjons dismounts and approaches the sleeping man jons addresses him politely when he doesnt receive an answer he walks up to the man in order to shake him awake he bends over the sleeping mans shoulder but quickly pulls back his hand the man falls backward on the heath his face turned towards jons it is a corpse staring at jons with empty eye sockets and white teethjons remounts and overtakes his master he takes a drink from his waterskin and hands the bag to the knightknight well did he show you the wayjons not exactlyknight what did he sayjons nothingknight was he a mutejons no sir i wouldnt say that as a matter of fact he was quite eloquentknight ohjons he was eloquent all right the trouble is that what he had to say was most depressing

one moment youre bright and lively the next youre crawling with worms fate is a terrible villain and you my friend its poor victimknight must you singjons nothe knight hands his squire a piece of bread which keeps him quiet for a while the sun burns down on them cruelly and beads of perspiration trickle down their faces there is a cloud of dust around the horses hooves they ride past an inlet and along verdant groves in the shade of some large trees stands a bulging wagon covered with a mottled canvas a horse whinnies nearby and is answered by the knights horse the two travelers do not stop to rest under the shade of the trees but continue riding until they disappear at the bend of the roadin his sleep jof the juggler hears the neighing of his horse and the answer from a distance he tries to go on sleeping but it is stifling inside the wagon the rays of the sun filtering through the canvas cast streaks of light across the face of jofs wife mia and their oneyearold son mikael who are sleeping deeply and peacefully near them jonas skat an older man snores loudlyjof crawls out of the wagon there is still a spot of shade under the big trees he takes a drink of water gargles stretches and talks to his scrawny old horsejof good morning have you had breakfast i cant eat grass worse luck cant you teach me how were a little hard up people arent very interested in juggling in this part of the countryhe has picked up the juggling balls and slowly begins to toss them then he stands on his head and cackles like a hen suddenly he stops and sits down with a look of utter astonishment on his face the wind causes the trees to sway slightly the leaves stir and there is a soft murmur the flowers and the grass bend gracefully and somewhere a bird raises its voice in a long warblejofs face breaks into a smile and his eyes fill with tears with a dazed expression he sits flat on his behind while the grass rustles softly and bees and butterflies hum around his head the unseen bird continues to singsuddenly the breeze stops blowing the bird stops singing jofs smile fades the flowers and grass wilt in the heat the old horse is still walking around grazing and swishing its tail to ward off the fliesjof comes to life he rushes into the wagon and shakes mia awakejof mia wake up wake up mia ive just seen something ive got to tell you about itmia sits up terrified

painter yes he dances off with all of them
jons why do you paint such nonsensepainter i thought it would serve to remind people that they must die
jons well its not going to make them feel any happierpainter why should one always make people happy it might not be a bad idea to scare them a little once in a whilejons then theyll close their eyes and refuse to look at your painting
painter oh theyll look a skull is almost more interesting than a naked woman
jons if you do scare them painter theyll thinkjons and if they think 
painter theyll become still more scared
jons and then theyll run right into the arms of the priestspainter thats not my business
jons youre only painting your dance of deathpainter im only painting things as they are everyone else can do as he likesjons just think how some people will curse youpainter maybe but then ill paint something amusing for them to look at i have to make a living  at least until the plague takes me
jons the plague that sounds horriblepainter you should see the boils on a diseased mans throat you should see how his body shrivels up so that his legs look like knotted strings  like the man ive painted over therethe painter points with his brush jons sees a small human form writhing in the grass its eyes turned upwards in a frenzied look of horror and painjons that looks terriblepainter it certainly does he tries to rip out the boil he bites his hands tears his veins open with his fingernails and his screams can be heard everywhere does that scare you
jons scare me you dont know me what are the horrors youve painted over therepainter the remarkable thing is that the poor creatures

the air is cool and musty pictures of saints look down on him with stony eyes christs face is turned upwards his mouth open as if in a cry of anguish on the ceiling beam there is a representation of a hideous devil spying on a miserable human being the knight hears a sound from the confession booth and approaches it the face of death appears behind the grille for an instant but the knight doesnt see himknight i want to talk to you as openly as i can but my heart is emptydeath doesnt answer

knight how can we have faith in those who believe when we cant have faith in ourselves what is going to happen to those of us who want to believe but arent able to and what is to become of those who neither want to nor are capable of believingthe knight stops and waits for a reply but no one speaks or answers him there is complete silenceknight why cant i kill god within me why does he live on in this painful and humiliating way even though i curse him and want to tear him out of my heart why in spite of everything is he a baffling reality that i cant shake off do you hear medeath yes i hear youknight i want knowledge not faith not suppositions but knowledge i want god to stretch out his hand towards me reveal himself and speak to medeath but he remains silent
knight
i call out to him in the dark but no one seems to be there
death perhaps no one is there

the devil with it come along and dont stand there staring ive saved your life so you owe me a great dealshe begins walking towards him her head bent he doesnt wait for her but walks towards the knight who patiently awaits his squirethe embarrassment inn lies in the eastern section of the province the plague has not yet reached this area on its way along the coastthe actors have placed their wagon under a tree in the yard of the inn dressed in colorful costumes they perform a farcethe spectators watch the performance commenting on it noisily there are
merchants with fat beersweaty faces apprentices and journeymen farmhands and milkmaids a whole flock of children perch in the trees around the wagon
the knight and his squire have sat down in the shadow of a wall they drink beer and doze in the midday heat the girl from the deserted village sleeps at jonss side skat beats the drums jof blows the flute mia performs a gay and lively dance they perspire under the hot white sun when they have finished skat comes forward and bowsskat noble ladies and gentlemen i thank you for your interest please remain standing for a
little longer or sit on the ground because we are now going to perform a tragedia about an unfaithful wife her jealous husband and the handsome lover  thats memia and jof have quickly changed costumes and again step out on the stage they bow to the publicskat here is the husband here is the wife if youll shut up over there youll see something splendid as i said i play the lover and i havent entered yet thats why im going to hide behind the curtain for the time being he wipes the sweat from his forehead
its damned hot i think well have a thunderstormhe places his leg in front of jof as if to trip him raises mias skirt makes a face as if he could see all the wonders of the world underneath it and disappears behind the gaudily patched curtainsskat is very handsome now that he can see himself in the reflection of a tin washbowl his hair is tightly curled his eyebrows are beautifully bushy glittering earrings vie for equal attention with his teeth and his cheeks are flushed rose red
he sits out in back on the tailboard of the wagon dangling his legs and whistling to himself
in the meantime jof and mia play their tragedy it is not however received with great acclaim skat suddenly discovers that someone is watching him as he gazes contentedly into the tin bowl a woman stands there stately in both height and volume
skat frowns toys with his small dagger and occasionally throws a roguish but fiery glance at the beautiful visitor she suddenly discovers that one of her shoes doesnt quite fit she leans down to fix it and in doing so allows her generous bosom to burst out of its prison  no more than honor and chastity allow but still enough so that the actor with his experienced eye immediately sees that there are ample rewards to be had herenow she comes a little closer kneels down and opens a bundle containing several dainty morsels and a skin filled with red wine jonas skat manages not to fall off the wagon in his excitement standing on the steps of the wagon he supports himself against a nearby tree crosses his legs and bows
the woman quietly bites into a chicken leg dripping with fat at this moment the actor is stricken by a radiant glance full of lustful appetiteswhen he sees this look skat makes an instantaneous decision jumps down from the wagon and kneels in front of the blushing damselshe becomes weak and faint from his nearness looks at him with a glassy glance and breathes heavily skat doesnt neglect to press kisses on her small chubby hands the sun shines brightly and small birds make noises in the bushesnow she is forced to sit back her legs seem unwilling to support her any longer bewildered she singles out another chicken leg from the large sack of food and holds it up in front of skat with an appealing and triumphant expression as if it were her maidenhood being offered as a prizeskat hesitates momentarily but he is still the strategist he lets the chicken leg fall to the grass and murmurs in the womans rosy earhis words seem to please her she puts her arms around the actors neck and pulls him to her with such fierceness that both of them lose their balance and tumble down on the soft grass the small birds take to their wings with frightened shrieksjof stands in the hot sun with a flickering lantern in his hand mia pretends to be asleep on a bench which has been pulled forward on the stagejof night and moonlight now prevail here sleeps my wife so frail voice from the public
does she snorejof may i point out that this is a tragedy and in tragedies one doesnt snorevoice from the public
i think she should snore anyhowthis opinion causes mirth in the audience jof becomes slightly confused and goes out of character but mia keeps her head and begins snoringjof night and moonlight now prevail
there snores  i mean sleeps  my wife so frail jealous i am as never before i hide myself behind this door faithful is she to her lover  not me he soon comes astealing to awaken her lusty feeling i shall now kill him dead for cuckolding me in my bed there he comes in the moonlight his white legs shining bright quiet as a mouse here ill lie tell him not that hes about to diejof hides himself mia immediately ends her snoring and sits up looking to the leftmia look there he comes in the night my lover my hearts delightshe becomes silent and looks wideeyed in front of her the mood in the yard in front of the inn has up to now been rather lighthearted despite the heat
now a rapid change occurs people who had been laughing and chattering fall silent their faces seem to pale under their sunbrowned skins the children stop their games and stand with gaping mouths and frightened eyes
jof steps out in front of the curtain his painted face bears an expression of horror mia has risen with mikael in her arms some of the women in the yard have fallen on their knees others hide their faces many begin to mutter halfforgotten prayersall have turned their faces towards the white road now a shrill song is heard it is frenzied almost a scream a crucified christ sways above the hilltopthe crossbearers soon come into sight they are dominican monks their hoods pulled down over their faces more and more of them follow carrying litters with heavy coffins or clutching holy relics their hands stretched out spasmodically the dust wells up around their black hoods the censers sway and emit a thick ashen smoke which smells of rancid herbsafter the line of monks comes another procession it is a column of men boys old men women girls children all of them have steeledged scourges in their hands with which they whip themselves and each other howling ecstatically they twist in pain their eyes bulge wildly their lips are gnawed to shreds and dripping with foam they have been seized by madness they bite their own hands and arms whip each other in violent almost rhythmic outbursts throughout it all the shrill song howls from their bursting throats many sway and fall lift themselves up again support each
other and help each other to intensify the scourgingnow the procession pauses at the crossroads in front of the inn the monks fall on their knees hiding their faces with clenched hands arms pressed tightly together their song never stops the christ figure on its timbered cross is raised above the heads of the crowd it is not christ triumphant but the suffering jesus with the sores the blood the hammered nails and the face in convulsive pain the son of god nailed on the wood of the cross suffering scorn and shame
the penitents have now sunk down in the dirt of the road they collapse where they stood like slaughtered cattle their screams rise with the song of the monks through misty clouds of incense towards the white fire of the sun
a large square monk rises from his knees and reveals his face which is red
brown from the sun his eyes glitter his voice is thick with impotent scornmonk
god has sentenced us to punishment we shall all perish in the black death you standing there like gaping cattle you who sit there in your glutted complacency do you know that this may be your last hour death stands right behind you i can see how his crown gleams in the sun his scythe flashes as he raises it above your heads which one of you shall he strike first you there who stand staring like a goat will your mouth be twisted into the last unfinished gasp before nightfall and you woman who bloom with life and self
satisfaction will you pale and become extinguished before the morning dawns you back
there with your swollen nose and stupid grin do you have another year left to dirty the earth with your refuse do you know you insensible fools that you shall die today or tomorrow or the next day because all of you have been sentenced do you hear what i say do you hear the word you have been sentenced sentencedthe monk falls silent looking around with a bitter face and a cold scornful
glance now he clenches his hands straddles the ground and turns his face
upwardsmonk
lord have mercy on us in our humiliation dont turn your face from us in loathing and contempt but be merciful to us for the sake of your son jesus christhe makes the sign of the cross over the crowd and then begins a new song in a
strong voice the monks rise and join in the song as if driven by some superhuman force the penitents begin to whip themselves again still wailing and moaningthe procession continues new members have joined the rear of the column others who were unable to go on lie weeping in the dust of the road jons the squire drinks his beerjons this damned ranting about doom is that food for the minds of modern people do they really expect us to take them seriouslythe knight grins tiredlyjons yes now you grin at me my lord but allow me to point out that ive either read heard or experienced most of the tales which we people tell each otherknight yawns yes yes
jons even the ghost stories about god the father the angels jesus christ and the holy ghost

the shrubbery nightingales sing and their voices echo through the stillness
the players wagon stands in a small ravine and not far away the horse grazes on the dry grass mia has sat down in front of the wagon with her son in her arms they play together and laugh happilynow a soft gleam of light strokes the hilltops a last reflection from the red clouds over the seanot far from the wagon the knight sits crouched over his chess game he lifts his headthe evening light moves across the heavy wagon wheels across the woman and the child the knight gets upmia sees him and smiles she holds up her struggling son as if to amuse the knightknight whats his namemia mikaelknight how old is hemia oh hell soon be twoknight hes big for his agemia do you think so yes i guess hes rather bigshe puts the child down on the ground and half rises to shake out her red skirt when she sits down again the knight steps closerknight you played some kind of show this afternoonmia did you think it was badknight you are more beautiful now without your face painted and this gown is more becomingmia you see jonas skat has run off and left us so were in real trouble nowknight is that your husbandmia laughs

what is it does it hurt what can i do have they been cruel to you she runs for a rag which she dips in water and carefully bathes her husbands

eventually a rather sorrowful visage emerges blood runs from a bruise on his forehead and his nose and a tooth has been loosened but otherwise jof seems unhurtjof ouch it hurtsmia
why did you have to go there and of course you drankmias anxiety has been replaced by a mild anger she pats him a little harder than necessaryjof ouch i didnt drink anythingmia
