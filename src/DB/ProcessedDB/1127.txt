remembers itthe next day as he drives to work the radio in trumans car begins to strangely broadcast every movement he makes growing increasingly paranoid truman opts to walk around in the open air outside he parks and ducks into a building he makes his way towards the elevator and as the doors open is surprised to see not an empty car but an entrance to what seems to be a studio filled with people wearing headphones and eating sandwiches before he can register what hes seeing security grabs him and pushes him out of the building for trespassingconfused truman walks to a nearby market where he sees marlons service vehicle parked truman tries to explain to marlon what he just experienced but marlon passes it off as truman trying to be funny truman pulls marlon aside and tells him that hes his best friend and needs to confide that hes going to be going away for a whilewhen he returns home truman finds meryl and his mother looking at photos in an old album they show him and look on together as the tv begins to play an old film called show me the way to go home a clear attempt to reassure the notion of never leaving home as truman looks back at the photo album his eyes fall on a picture of his wedding day with meryl looking closer he sees that her fingers are crossed which implies that meryl did not marry truman truthfullytruman goes to a travel agency the next day to book a flight to fiji but the agent judy clayton tells him that there are no available flights for at least a month when he tries to take a bus to chicago the bus breaks down before it can leave the stationwhen meryl comes home from work she finds truman sitting in his car in the driveway fixated on something she goes to the car and sits with him but he tells her to be silent before predicting the appearance of every person along the street as if they were on a fixed schedule meryl tells him that his behavior is worrying but he decides to put his theory to a bigger test he drives off down the street with meryl who demands that they return home when they come to a rotary a traffic jam suddenly appears truman feigns disappointment and takes the car around the rotary multiple times when he comes back to the blocked road all the cars have vanished and he continues towards the only bridge that leads off the island however truman is forced to stop at the bridge when he realizes that he cant drive over because of his fear of water instead he closes his eyes and slams his foot on the gas forcing meryl to drive victorious truman cries out as meryl continues to try and convince him to return home they pass a sign warning of forest fires and a line of flames shoots across the road but truman drives onward the car is finally stopped just beyond a power plant that appears to have experienced a meltdown men in hazmat suits approach the car and apologize for the inconvenience but when one of them accidentally calls truman by his first name they would of course not know otherwise truman gets out of the car and attempts to make a break for it the men chase after him and manage to capture him and return him to the islandonce home meryl tries to console a dejected truman by offering him a new drink she picked up however she promotes the item as if on a commercial which prompts truman to ask who she thinks shes talking to meryl becomes upset and blames trumans recent behavior but truman becomes more frantic and tries to convince meryl that theres something wrong with everything becoming scared meryl takes a peeler and aims it at truman telling him to keep his distance when he grabs it away from her and puts her in a lock hold she calls out for someone to stop him truman in shock releases her and demands to know whats going on marlon appears at the door and walks in with a case of beer as if to casually hang out and meryl runs into his arms crying that its not professionalmarlon takes truman out where they sit at the edge of a road sharing the beers marlon tries to assure truman that if everyone was in on a massive scheme or conspiracy hed have to be in on it too he tells truman that the last thing he would ever want to do is lie to him but he says this as christof feeds him his words through an earpiece marlon then tells truman the real reason he stopped by and took him out tonight they stand and look behind them where a dark figure emerges from the mist marlon tells truman that he was able to find the homeless man hed seen and as the man gets closer truman realizes that it is his father the two embrace while christof composes the cinematography from above and revels in his master shot of truman weeping with happiness trumans father promises to make up for all the lost yearsshortly after this moment a weekly tv show titled trutalk begins while a smaller screen in the righthand corner of the television shows truman as he eats his breakfast christof is interviewed and he explains the reasoning behind many things that have happened on the show the purpose of killing his father out at sea was to implant the fear of water in truman so that he would have no wish of leaving the island this decision was reinforced by his youthful wishes to explore and discover which often nearly led him to discover his own captivity bringing his father back now was done with the hopes to quell trumans emotional turmoil and soothe him into remaining on the island despite all thats happened various security measures were taken in light of a few occurrences one of which involved a truman fan marco rubeo hiding himself in a christmas present of trumans when he was a child in order to get airtimea caller rings in and christof accepts to answer questions he recognizes sylvias voice as she berates christof for keeping up the charade and imprisoning truman within a mockery of life christof counters by saying that the real world is a prison and that what he has done is to actually give truman the chance to lead a completely normal life free of violence or pain and says that should truman discover the truth he could leavethe following day truman appears to be well and back to his normal self he greets his neighbors and heads off to work where he meets a new coworker named vivien meryls appointed replacement as trumans prospective female partner that evening truman moves some things around his basement appearing to reorganize before pulling on some covers on a makeshift bed and falling asleep after several hours of inactivity even when truman should be awake christof becomes suspicious while watching the video feed he orders that the phone ring in the house when truman doesnt answer much less move christof sends marlon over cueing him the entire time as to what to do marlon goes into the basement and pulls trumans covers back to find a noise recorder and a gaping hole in the basement floor at a loss of what to do or say christof does the unthinkable he cuts the transmissionthe cease in transmission puts the world into a state of shock and christof orders the entire staff on the island to form search parties performing a godlike move over the set christof commands the sun to rise to aid in the search when the search on land has been exhausted christof suggests an impossible idea search at sea his intuition proves correct as cameras pan over the ocean and locate a lone sailboat with truman at the helm the live video feeds continue and christof orders one of the actors to go out and fetch truman however being actors none of them know how to man a boatchristof utilizes his weather program to simulate a storm to entice truman to go back to port however truman battens down and yells to the skies in defiance angry christof increases the wind and turbulence nearly causing truman to fall overboard knowing that truman will never back down christof pull the plug on the weather truman continues sailing victorious until the boat is rocked by a strong impact truman collects himself and finds that the bow of the ship has lodged intothe sky he has come to the end of the dome he gets off of the boat and examines the wall following it a short ways until he finds a short staircase leading to an exit door as he reaches for the handle christof speaks on the intercom system to truman directly for the first time he introduces himself as the creator who has been watching truman since the day he was born and revealing his life as entertainment for a world beyond christof tries to convince truman to stay within his world where he can live happily and without suffering or pain and tries to plant the idea that truman is still deathly afraid of continuing ontruman appears deep in thought and christof suggests that he say something after all the entire world is watching truman looks up and says in case i dont see you good afternoon good evening and good night he bows as christof looks on incredulously opens the door and leaves an elated sylvia jumps up from her living room floor and leaves her apartment as the rest of the world cheers tremendously at the finale of the truman showa saddened but resolute christof removes his head piece and cuts the transmission 8.0island hidden
