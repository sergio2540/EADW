ronald d moore ethan phillips ray uhler michael zaslow the time is the 24th century and the ship is the newlycommissioned enterprisee its captain jeanluc picard has been ordered not to interfere in a battle between a borg cube and ships from the federation however seeing the federation is about to lose picard ignore his orders and takes command of the defending fleet with his knowledge of the cubes weak spot they destroy it however a small part of it escapes and plots a course directly for earth the enterprise chases it and enters a time distortion created by the borg they end up in the mid21st century and their only chance of stopping the borg from assimilating earth is to help zefram cochrane make his famous first fasterthanlight travel to the stars the borg have returned in another attempt to conquer earth disregarding orders captain picard and the new enterprisee rush to save the federation homeworld only to get sucked back in time with the borg as they attempt to interfere with the course of humankinds evolution into a peaceful unified race if zefram cochrane does not make his flight in the mid21st century a routine vulcan mapping mission would not detect the warp signature and first contact would not be made the borg go back in time to destroy his ship once an american nuclear missile left over from world war iii they call themselves the borg  a halforganic halfmachine collective with a sole purpose to assimilate and conquer all races led by their seductive and sadistic queen the borg are headed to earth with a devious plan to alter history after an epic battle against the borg captain jeanluc picard and the crew of the enterprise follow the borg sphere back into the 21st century and must battle the borg queen before she assimilates mankind meanwhile picard and his crew must make sure that zefram cochrane makes his historic maiden flight at warp speed and makes earths first contact it is the 24th century and a collective of parthumanoid partmachine beings face the federation in what would be the biggest battle of all time this collective called the borg lose and desperately attempt to go back in time to april 4 2063 to stop earths first contact with an alien species the vulcans to be precise captain picard and the crew of the enterprise ncc1701e go back in time to make sure that zefram cochrane makes his famous warp flight however the enterprisee runs into unexpected trouble when the borg start to assimilate the starship captain jeanluc picard awakens from a nightmare in which he relived his assimilation by the cybernetic borg six years earlier previously shown in the television episode the best of both worlds he is contacted by admiral hayes who informs him of a new borg attack against earth picards orders are for his ship the uss enterprisee to patrol the neutral zone in case of romulan aggression as starfleet is worried that picard is too emotionally involved with the borg to join the fight learning the fleet is losing the battle the enterprise crew disobeys orders and heads for earth where a single borg cube ship holds its own against a group of starfleet vessels the enterprise arrives in time to save the crew of the uss defiant and its captain the klingon worf picard takes control of the fleet and directs the surviving ships to concentrate their firepower on a seemingly unimportant point on the borg ship1 the cube is destroyed after launching a smaller sphere ship towards the planet the enterprise pursues the sphere into a temporal vortex as the sphere disappears the enterprise discovers earth has been altered and is now populated entirely by borg realizing the borg have used time travel to change the past the enterprise follows the sphere through the vortex2the enterprise travels to april 4 2063 the day before humanitys first encounter with alien life after zefram cochranes historic warp drive flight the crew realizes the borg are trying to prevent first contact after destroying the borg sphere an away team transports down to the site where cochrane is building his ship the phoenix in montana picard has cochranes assistant lily sloane sent back to the enterprise for medical attention the captain returns to the ship and leaves commander william t riker on earth to make sure the phoenixs flight proceeds as planned3 while in the future cochrane is seen as a hero the real man is reluctant to assume the role the enterprise crew describe2a group of borg invade the enterprises lower decks and begin to assimilate its crew and modify the ship picard and a team attempt to reach engineering to disable the borg with a corrosive gas but are forced back the android data is captured in the melee a frightened sloane corners picard with a weapon but he gains her trust the two escape the borginfested area of the ship by creating a diversion in the holodeck3 picard worf and the ships navigator lt hawk travel outside the ship in space suits to stop the borg from calling reinforcements by using the deflector dish they destroy the disc but hawk is assimilated as the borg continue to assimilate more decks worf suggests destroying the ship but picard angrily calls him a coward and vows to continue the fight sloane confronts the captain and makes him realize he is acting irrationally due to his desire for revenge chastened picard relents and orders the activation of the ships selfdestruct mechanism while the crew head for escape pods the captain decides to stay behind and rescue his friend data4as cochrane riker and engineer geordi la forge prepare to activate the warp drive on the phoenix picard discovers that the borg queen has grafted human skin onto data and with it an array of new sensations she has presented this modification as a gift to the android hoping to obtain the androids encryption codes to the enterprise computer although picard offers himself to the borg in exchange for datas freedom data refuses to leave he deactivates the selfdestruct sequence and fires torpedoes at the phoenix at the last moment the torpedoes miss and the queen realizes data betrayed her4 the android ruptures a coolant tank and the corrosive vapor eats away the biological components of the borg with the borg threat neutralized cochrane completes his warp flight2 the next day the crew watches from a distance as an alien vulcan ship attracted by the phoenix warp test lands on earth cochrane and sloane greet the aliens having ensured the correction of the timeline the enterprise crew slip away and return to the 24th century 7.6borg captain
