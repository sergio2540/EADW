mike tellegen rafael trujillo jacques vanaire ellinor vanderveer norma varden hans heinrich von twardowski leo white jack wise wolfgang zilzer in world war ii casablanca rick blaine exiled american and former freedom fighter runs the most popular nightspot in town the cynical lone wolf blaine comes into the possession of two valuable letters of transit when nazi major strasser arrives in casablanca the sycophantic police captain renault does what he can to please him including detaining a czechoslovak underground leader victor laszlo much to ricks surprise lazslo arrives with ilsa ricks one time love rick is very bitter towards ilsa who ran out on him in paris but when he learns she had good reason to they plan to run off together again using the letters of transit well that was their original plan during world war ii europeans who were fleeing from the germans sought refuge in america but to get there they would first have to go casablanca and once they get there they have to obtain exit visas which are not very easy to come by now the hottest spot in all of casablanca is ricks cafe which is operated by rick blaine an american expatriate who for some reason cant return there and he is also extremely cynical now it seems that two german couriers were killed and the documents they were carrying were taken now one of ricks regulars ugarte entrusts to him some letters of transit which he intends to sell but before he does he is arrested for killing the couriers captain renault the chief of police who is neutral in his political views informs rick that victor laszlo a resistance leader from czechoslovakia is in casablanca and will do anything to get an exit visa but renault has been told by major strasser of the gestapo to keep laszlo in casablanca laszlo goes to ricks to meet ugarte because he was the one ugarte was going to sell the letters to but since ugarte was arrested he has to find another way accompanying him is ilsa lund who knew rick when he was in paris and when they meet some of ricks old wounds reopen it is obvious that ricks stone heart was because of her leaving him and when they learn that rick has the letters he refuses to give them to him because he doesnt stick his neck out for anyone rick blaine who owns a nightclub in casablanca discovers his old flame ilsa is in town with her husband victor laszlo laszlo is a resistance leader from czechoslovakia and with germans on his tail ilsa knows rick can help them get out of the country  but will he in the early years of world war ii the moroccan coastal city of casablanca attracts people from all over the world particularly nazioccupied europe many are transients trying to get out of europe a few are just trying to make a buck most of them  gamblers and refugees nazis resistance fighters and plain old crooks  find their way to ricks café américain a swank nightclub owned by american expatriate rick blaine humphrey bogart though we learn later that rick once harbored enough idealism to put himself at risk to fight fascism hes now embittered and cynical professing to be neutral and detached i stick my neck out for nobodyugarte peter lorre comes to ricks with letters of transit he obtained by killing two german couriers the papers allow the bearer to travel freely around germancontrolled europe including to neutral lisbon portugal from lisbon its relatively easy to get to the united states they are almost priceless to any of the refugees stranded in casablanca ugarte plans to make his fortune by selling them to the highest bidder who is due to arrive at the club later that night however before the exchange can take place ugarte is arrested by the police under the command of captain louis renault claude rains a corrupt vichy official renault accommodates the nazis unknown to renault and the nazis ugarte had left the letters with rick for safekeeping because somehow just because you despise me youre the only one i trustthen the reason for ricks bitterness reenters his life ilsa lund ingrid bergman arrives with her husband victor laszlo paul henreid to purchase the letters laszlo is a renowned czech resistance leader who has escaped from a nazi concentration camp they must have the letters to escape to america to continue his work at the time ilsa first met and fell in love with rick in paris she believed her husband had been killed when she discovered that he was still alive she left rick abruptly without explanation and returned to laszlo leaving rick feeling betrayed after the club closes ilsa returns to try to explain but rick is drunk and bitterly refuses to listenat different times rick and ilsa torment themselves by asking the clubs piano player sam arthur dooley wilson to play as time goes by a song they loved when they were together in paris the famous line play it again sam which refers to this song doesnt actually appear in the movie  ilsa says play it sam and later rick orders play it while sam plays the song rick reminisces about his affair with ilsa in paris though she seems happy to be with rick her mood near the end of their time together is cautious because she has learned her husband may not be dead when the nazis begin to close in on paris she receives word that victor is indeed alive in another part of europe she and rick had been planning to take a train to southern france to escape the german armys assault however on the platform rick receives a handwritten letter from her she writes that she cant explain why shes leaving him but she loves him rick and sam leave without herthe next night laszlo suspecting that rick has the letters speaks with him privately about obtaining them theyre interrupted when a group of nazi officers led by major strasser conrad veidt commandeer sams piano and begin to sing die wacht am rhein the watch on the rhine a german patriotic song infuriated laszlo orders the house band to play la marseillaise in honor of occupied france the band leader looks to rick for guidance he nods laszlo starts singing alone at first then longsuppressed patriotic fervor grips the crowd and everyone joins in drowning out the germans in retaliation strasser orders renault to close the clublater that night ilsa confronts rick in the deserted cafe he refuses to give her the documents even when threatened with a gun she is unable to shoot confessing that she still loves him rick decides to help laszlo leading her to believe that she will stay behind when laszlo leaveslaszlo is jailed on a minor charge rick convinces renault to release laszlo promising to set him up for a much more serious crime possession of the letters of transit however rick double crosses renault forcing him at gunpoint to assist in the escape at the last moment rick makes ilsa get on the plane to lisbon with her husband telling her that she would regret it if she stayed maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but soon and for the rest of your lifemajor strasser drives up tipped off by renault but rick shoots him when he tries to intervene when his men arrive renault informs them that strasser is dead and covers for rick by sharply ordering them to round up the usual suspects he then recommends that they both leave casablanca renault suggesting they join the resistance walks into the fog with rick who says louis i think this is the
