carliez laurence cormerais gérard depardieu jacques weber in 1832 cholera ravages provence south of france after several misadventures angelo young italian officer hunted by the austrian secret police meets pauline de theus a young lady after a second accidental meeting both will start the search of paulines husband in a chaotic country beautiful cinematography beautiful actors sets and landscapes directing a little suspect with some slapstick influences occasionally which seemed to be out of context  the two heos travel back and forth across cholera infested france never laying a hand on each other until the dying moments of the filmle hussard is an italian master horseman and swordsman who has left his mother in itlay to gather funds for the revolutions against austria seems to be some time delays as the revolution was a little later maybe he didnt collect as much as was necessary to form the governmant that the wealthy and educated italians wished for in the 1830s giuseppe mazzini organized the la giovine italia an organization which supported several failed insurrections in various parts of italy it was probably one of these and the film doesnt address them having the action in france and essentially dwelling upon the actors and their relationship 7.1provence police austrian cholera cleansing-by-fire theus-france raining-toads resistance-fighter celebration mountain
