history museum returns from south america with some crates containing his findings when the crates arrive at the museum without the owner there appears to be very little inside however police discover gruesome murders on the cargo ship that brought the crates to the us and then another murder in the museum itself investigating the murders is lt vincent dagosta who enlists the help of dr margo green at the museum  she has taken an interest in the contents of her colleagues crates unknown to both there is a large creature roaming the museum which is gearing itself up for a benefit reception which the citys mayor is to attend somewhere in the brazilian rain forest anthropologist john whitney lewis van bergen witnesses an aboriginal tribal ritual performed by dancing men in a state of trance he drinks a kind of potion concocted by the tribes witch montrose hughes using leaves with a kind of red fungal growth on them after drinking it he becomes hysterical at the sight of a native dressed in a costume and wearing facepaint whitney says to himself oh my god its kathogalater whitney shows up at a commercial dock where a cargo ship named the santos morales is ready to depart locating the ships captain santos morales whitney pleads with him to unload his crates destined for the chicago natural history museum refusing to help the captain boards the ship stowing away on board whitney locates the ship cargo hold and pries open one of the wooden crates finding only rugs inside he breaks down and screams in despair as the ship sails away several more crates sit on the dock labeled john whitney  chicago natural history museuma title card reads six weeks later as the same cargo ship arrives in chicago the dock is cordoned off by police and we meet lt vincent dagosta tom sizemore as he boards the ship with detective hollingsworth clayton rohner there are bloodstains everywhere and the crew appear to be all gone searching the cargo hold dagosta finds several of the crew in the bilge  their heads severed from their bodies dagosta is very superstitious and carries a lucky bullet for protectionmeanwhile the museum of natural history in chicago is busy preparing for the grand opening of a new exhibit which explores the origins of superstition as dr margo green penelope ann miller an evolutionary biologist arrives at work the museum curator dr ann cuthbert linda hunt tells margo she is in competition for a grant which she needs to continue her research at the museum to her chagrin margos colleague greg lee chi muoi lo has applied for the same grant the grant is provided by wealthy museum benefactors the blaisedales constance towers  francis x mccarthy who will attend the upcoming gala to open the new exhibitstopping by the office of dr albert frock james whitmore a colleague of john whitney margo is intrigued by the contents of several crates recently sent by airfreight from brazil the crates left behind by the ship the remnants of a stone artifact are wrapped in the green leaves used in the potion margo takes some of the leaves to analyze them while the remainder are incinerated in the basement of the museumas a school group on an excursion enters the museum two boys skipping school for the day sneak into the museum unnoticed and hide alone in the museum after closing they notice a bad smell in a basement stairwell and discover the body of a security guard jophery c brown which alerts the authorities to a killer on the loose the guard has been beheaded and his brain removed by the killerwhile an investigation gets underway led by lt vincent dagosta the stone artifact found inside the crates is gradually restored by a technician lynn a henderson for the new superstition exhibit it is revealed later to be a depiction of the mythical kathoga as albert frock explains kathoga was a chimera  a mythical creature that combined various animals into onethe coroner dr zwiezic audra lindley examines the beheaded corpse of the security guard with dagosta present and discovers the victims brain weighs less than it should it appears to be missing the hypothalamus and pituitary glands dagosta later finds out the beheaded victims on board the cargo ship were also missing the same parts of their brainsas police continue to search the museum for the killer a homeless man living in the cavernous basement is shot and killed by accident when he turns out to be a convicted rapist and felon the museums head of security is satisfied but dagosta isnt convinced there is still no explanation for the missing hypothalamuses or the deaths aboard the cargo ship but with the mayor of chicago robert lesser and his wife diane robin due to attend the opening night gala as guests of honor dagosta bows to pressure and lets the event go ahead but insists on heavy police presenceas the gala gets underway margo analyzes the leaves and discovers a link between the substance on them and the human hypothalamus the red substance contains a concentrated dose of the same hormones secreted by the hypothalamus enough to cause rapid mutation in animals or insects that feed on it when a beetle gets inside the container where the leaves are stored it grows to the size of a rat overnight margo shows her findings to dr albert frock who assists with her analysis of the beetles dna he subscribes to a theory called the calysto effect  a sudden jump in evolution which results in an aberrant speciesmeanwhile dagosta orders a search of the subterranean tunnels and old sewage system under the museum which links up with the docks something in the tunnel kills a search dog and his handler so dagosta orders detective hollingsworth back to the museum to evacuate the guests but its too lateas the vips finally enter the superstition exhibit the killer strikes again setting off a panic the security system locks down the museum trapping almost everyone inside while police try to break in and helicopters lower a swat team onto the roof dagosta orders the remaining guests into the tunnels which lead to the outsidethe blaisedales elect to stay behind in the museums main exhibit hall along with the ambitious greg lee and the head of security but they soon become victims of the kathoga which finally reveals itself as the swat team drops into the hall they too are killed by the beast which climbs walls and uses giant pincers to sever their headslocked in another wing of the museum margo and dr albert frock discover the origin of the beast which is a hybrid of insect reptile and various other animals including one human being  the missing john whitney as the kathoga he must consume huge quantities of the hormones found in the human hypothalamus to survivefinding margo alive and dr frock dead dagosta asks margo how to kill the beast they try unsuccessfully to freeze it in the tunnel using liquid nitrogen then flee back to the lab dagosta orders margo to lock herself in while he goes after the beast but the kathoga outwits them and drops through the roof of the lab while dagosta is locked on the other side of a metal door margo incinerates the kathoga when she blows up her lab using flammable chemicals as fuel while hiding inside a metal container filled with water 5.7museum crate mayor ship benefit anthropologist brain-eating head-ripped-off blood-spatter
