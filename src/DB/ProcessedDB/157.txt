group of six heads into killing barnes in retaliation while king agrees doc gomez paul sanchez believes they should wait for military justice to decide barnes fate rhah reminds taylor how much he admired barnes when he first arrived and that barnes isnt meant to die noting that on several previous occasions barnes has sustained wounds that ought to have proved mortal the only thing that can kill barnes is barnes barnes then appears very drunk with a bottle of bourbon having overheard taylor calling for his murder he enters the room daring them to kill him no one takes up the offer but as barnes leaves taylor attacks him barnes quickly gets the upper hand pins taylor down and holds a knife to his face rhah urges him not to do it telling barnes hell be courtmartialed and imprisoned and

doesnt give a fuck any more the troops try to prepare for the incoming battle during which they know the majority of them will die just hours before nightfall king is allowed to go home as his tour of duty has come to an end oneil tries to use elias rr days for himself in order to escape the impending battle in which he believes he will die when he asks barnes for permission barnes refuses saying everybody gotta die some time red junior tries to escape the battle by spraying mosquito repellent onto his feet and passing it off as trench foot a ploy that barnes recognizes right away bunny states

glover one of the last few remaining heads is assigned to the same foxhole as taylor that night a large attack occurs and the american defensive perimeter is broken and the camp overrun by hundreds of attacking north vietnamese troops taylor and francis take on and cut down several attacking enemy troops until they both pause when they hear signal whistles from the unseen nva sergeants ordering their men to cease fire hearing a vietnamese voice over a bullhorn and understanding that the nva are ordering rpgs up to the line to blow up the foxhole they are in taylor grabs francis and both of them crawl out of the foxhole seconds before its hit by an rpg taylor and francis then attack and kill several enemy soldiers that overrun their destroyed foxhole until taylor loses it during the

takes an ak47 rifle from a dead enemy soldier and aims it at barnes who lays helpless on the ground nonetheless barnes feels at first not threatened and he dismissively orders taylor to call a medic when taylor does not comply but instead continues to aim his weapon barnes deranged to the last dares him to pull the trigger by saying do it taylor shoots barnes three times in the chest killing him taylor then drops his rifle collapses and awaits medical attentioninterestingly although not in the script taylor is seen on the verge of pulling the pin of a grenade that he found only to drop it as reinforcements come to taylor charlie sheen thought that taylor would be committing suicide after killing barnes oliver stone thought that the mistake was good so he decided to keep it in the filmfrancis emerges from his foxhole and stabs himself with a bayonet in order to be evacuated as a casualty oneil is found by other americans and harris much to oneils distress gives him command of
