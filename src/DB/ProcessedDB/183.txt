alien ridley scott dan obannon ronald shusett dan obannon tom skerritt sigourney weaver veronica cartwright harry dean stanton john hurt ian holm yaphet kotto bolaji badejo helen horton eddie powell a commercial crew aboard the deep space towing vessel nostromo is on its way home when they pick an sos warning from a distant planet what they dont know is that the sos warning is not like any other ordinary warning call picking up the signal the crew realize that they are not alone on the spaceship when a alien stowaway is on the cargo ship when commercial towing vehicle nostromo heading back to earth intercepts an sos signal from a nearby planet the crew are under obligation to investigate after a bad landing on the planet some crew members leave the ship to explore the area at the same time as they discover a hive colony of some unknown creature the ships computer deciphers the message to be a warning not a call for help when one of the eggs is disturbed the crew do not realize the danger they are in in the near future during its return to the earth a commercial spaceship nostromo intercepts a distress sos from a distant planet the sevenmember crew are woken up from the hypersleep and the spaceship subsequently descends on the planet while exploring the planet a threemember team of the crew discovers a derelict spaceship and a huge chamber inside it containing thousands of eggs when a curious team member goes too near the egg the parasite inside the egg attacks him rendering him unconscious he is brought back aboard the spaceship takes off after a little while the parasite dies and his host wakes up seemingly unruffled everything returns back to normal  but not for long while returning from a deepspace mission the crew of the commercial spaceship nostromo is awakened by a supposed sos call from a system they are passing through descending to the planets surface they discover a strange derelict spaceship  the apparent source of the transmission  and one of the crew descends into the hold what he finds are thousands of strange alien eggs while examining one of the eggs it hatches and the parasite inside attacks him after returning to the nostromo the crew takes off again to head for earth the alien parasite subsequently dies and all seems well again but what no one knows is that another alien is quietly forming within its host  and when it emerges the crew finds itself in serious trouble scenes in red appear only in the 2003 directors cut scenes in blue appear only in the 1979 theatrical editionthe opening credits appear in front of a large planet with rings cut to the far reaches of deep space the nostromo a commercial towing space vehicle carrying a refinery with twenty million tons of mineral ore is en route to earth with a crew of seven inside the ship appears eerily quit but suddenly the onboard computer is activated lights inside the ship are activated and a room with 7 biobeds is illuminated the canopies open to wake the crew executive officer kane john hurt is the first to get out they congregate in the mess hall where they cheerfully enjoy a meal chief engineer parker yaphet kotto and engineering technician brett harry dean stanton take the opportunity to discuss the bonus system which they find unfair as they get paid less than the officers captain dallas tom skerritt is called away by mother the ships computer before they can have a meaningful conversation dallas enters the mother console room and tries to assess the situation as the rest of the crew gets in the cockpit of the ship to determine their location they quickly deduce that they are not home yet navigator lambert veronica cartwright finds out that they are at zeta ii reticuli and the ship is still quite far from earth when parker and brett return from their round of the lower deck complaining about their colleagues attitude and the bonus system dallas briefs the crew the ship is not even halfway home and has altered course because it has picked up an unknown signal which repeats every 12 seconds the crew has been awoken from cryosleep to investigate parker protests arguing that theyre not a rescue team and that they should be compensated for the extra work but science officer ash ian holm stipulates that per company contract the crew is obliged to investigate every signal from an intelligent source noncompliance will result in loss of pay which quickly gets parker in a cooperative moodthe crew assembles in the cockpit to listen to the signal it sounds very strange and unearthly perhaps like a voice lambert homes in on it and finds that it comes from a planetoid 1200 km in diameter with a 2 hour rotation and some gravitythe nostromo approaches the planet which is close to one enormous ringed planet and two smaller ones the ship separates from the refinery and sets course to the planets surface it descends toward the planet but the landing is rough causing damage that will take some time for parker and brett to fix although they allot themselves copious amounts of time the planet is windy and visibility is low as the source of the signal is 2000 meters away and the sun is coming up dallas and kane decide to investigate on foot a reluctant lambert is ordered to join ash takes place behind an outer window with a communication console as the team puts on the space suits and leaves the ship to investigate the signal on the planets windy surface in the meanwhile warrant officer ripley sigourney weaver has gone to the lower deck to inspect the repairs parker and brett ask if there will be a bonus for any discovery which is made on the surface ripley assures them that the law guarantees them a share before returning upstairs as they keep teasing her outside the team walks between the rocks through the planetoids inhabitable atmosphere inside the ship ash tells ripley that mother has not yet deciphered the signal she volunteers to give it a try ripley accesses a console and starts working on the strange signaloutside the sun is up and they wind has laid down the team clears the rock formation and makes a fascinating discovery near the horizon they see a derelict spacecraft of unknown origin it is lying against the rocks vaguely shaped like a horseshoe despite lamberts hesitation they approach it losing contact with the nostromo upon entering the massive ship through an opening at the side inside they find hallways with walls textured like bones at the end is an elevated platform it carries the remains of an enormous alien creature in a large chair now fossilized upon initial examination there is evidence of some unknown trauma to its chest its ribs are bent outward as if it exploded from the inside lambert wants to leave kane then draws the others attention to a large hole in the floormeanwhile analysis of the unidentified transmission suggests that it is not an sos but a warning ripley wants to go after the search party but ash talks her out of it reasoning that by the time she gets there the search team will probably know what the signal meanskane is lowered into the hole by means of a winch he finds an enormous tubelike hallway down below divided into sections and basins he nears one basin discovering thousands of leathery objects that resemble large eggs he also discovers a strange light and mist covering the eggs that reacts when broken he trips and falls into the pit but is okay and moves in to investigate further kane touches one of the eggs which seems to give a shriek he illuminates the egg from behind with a flashlight and discovers movement inside he grabs a pistol a strange spiderlike organism is the resident the egg has flaps on top which open revealing its insides as kane moves into for a better look the strange life form inside suddenly leaps out attaching itself to kanes helmetash is looking towards the planets surface when he sees dallas and lambert carrying the unconscious kane back to the nostromo they enter the airlock and ask ripley to let them in while ash waits at the inner airlock door to open it they inform ripley that an organism has attached itself to kanes face ripley hesitates citing quarantine protocol for the safety of the crew kane should first be decontaminated for 24 hours before being brought on board dallas fears for kanes life and orders her to open the door but she refuses despite dallas trying to pull rank however ash disregards ripleys decision and lets them inin the infirmary dallas and ash cut kanes helmet open they find a spiderlike creature attaching itself to kanes face with eight fingers and a long tail wrapped around his neck despite his mouth being blocked kane is breathing heavily parker brett and lambert observe through a window ripley joins them and is angrily slapped by a furious lambert for not allowing them to reenter the ship the men break the women apart dallas berates ripley for disobeying a direct order but ripley furiously replies that she was just following the rules ash attempts to remove the creature from kanes face with a pair of pliers but it merely tightens its grip and is holding on so tight that it will tear kanes skin with it kane is examined with a sophisticated medical scanner which shows that the creature has inserted a tube into kanes throat and is feeding him oxygen ash deduces that since kane is comatose and the parasite is feeding him oxygen removing the creature may kill kane dallas is willing to take the riskash tries to cut off one of its legs with a scalpel but a yellowish fluid pours out of the wound and begins to eat through the floor out of concern that the acidic fluid will breach the hull the crew runs several floors downstairs and find that the stuffs corrosive effects is neutralized after burning through several decks dallas says the substance resembles molecular acid and brett comments the creature must be using it for blood wonderful defense mechanism  you dont dare kill it growls parker dallas orders everyone back to their posts as kane is left in his coma to be tended by ashparker and brett resume their repairs commenting that they should never have landed on the planet as kanes situation remains unchanged ash is collecting data on the creature he is startled by the sudden presence of ripley in the infirmary she wants to know what he has found out yet ash can only confirm that the creatures skin is made up of polysaccharides which it is slowly replacing with silicon to toughen itself up ripley then confronts him with his decision to let it aboard ignoring the quarantine law ash defends himself by stating he temporarily forgot the fact that ripley is the officer in charge when dallas and kane are away and that he did it out of concern for kanes life ripley replies that by allowing this he has put all of their lives at risk which is not appropriate behavior for a science officer ash coldly lets her know that he is perfectly capable to make that decision and she should stick to her own job ripley leavesdallas is sitting in the nostromos escape shuttle the narcissus listening to music when he is called to the infirmary by ash because something has happened to kane the creature has detached from kanes face on its own and has disappeared dallas ripley and ash search the infirmary and find it when it suddenly drops from an overhead compartment on an unsuspecting ripley it appears to be dead only showing basic reflexes they take a closer look at it and confirm it is dead ripley wants to get rid of it fearing that it may become even more harmful when dead ash strongly disagrees given the uniqueness of the specimen he wants to take it back to earth for more tests as it is harmless now dallas shares ripleys sentiment but leaves the decision to ash to ripleys amazementripley tries to talk some sense into dallas who is unwilling to listen to her arguments replying that he only runs the ship and the science officer has the final word on all things scientific apparently this is standard procedure nowadays as per the almighty companys regulations ripley asks if dallas has ever worked with ash before dallas mentions that he did five tours with the same science officer but this person was suddenly replaced two days before the nostromo left thedus dock ripley admits she doesnt trust ash but dallas responds that he doesnt trust anybody he asks about the status of repairs which are still underway but appear completed enough to take the ship off even though ripley does not recommend it dallas prefers to leave as soon as possibleafter a successful takeoff and despite some minor technical errors the ship docks with the refinery and cargo in orbit the nostromo then resumes its course for earththe crew is back in the mess hall bickering again about what to do with kane dallas decides they will all get back into cryosleep lambert has calculated that it will take another 10 months to get back to earth which spoils their moods even further ash suddenly calls dallas to the infirmary kane has awoken still groggy but seemingly unharmed he remembers very little of the event but is starved and wants to eat the crew decides to have one last meal before they reenter cryosleep during the meal the crew is finally having a good time again joking and enjoying the food kane is eating like he hasnt got food in ages sharply observed by ash suddenly kane begins to choke after initially thinking he has swallowed something bad the mood suddenly changes when kane starts to groan and convulse violently while he lies writhing and screaming on the table the crew tries to aid and stabilize him but his chest suddenly bursts and a small snakelike alien creature erupts from his insides it silently observes its surroundings parker moves in to kill it with a knife but he is stopped by ash the creature screeches then scurries away quickly leaving the crew stunned and horrifieda quick search through the deck yields no results whatsoever after a short funeral for kane where his body is jettisoned into space the crew members split up into two teams to capture the small creature brett assembles a weapon similar to a cattle prod while ash rigs together a tracking device parker brett and ripley investigate one of the lower decks finding that the power has been disrupted despite repairs having been finished picking up a signal they think they have the creature cornered in a cupboard they prepare to catch it in a net only to be startled by the discovery that it is the crews cat jones who had found a quiet place inside the cupboard and runs away realizing they might pick up the cat on the tracker again later parker sends brett off to catch jones as brett is searching for jones he finds a mysterious object resembling a shedded snake skin on the floor he continues on to a hold housing one of the ships landing struts eventually catching up with jones a strange creature is hanging in the chains above him seemingly observing him as brett tries to coax jones out the cat hisses when a huge shape drops down behind him it is the creature however now with four limbs an elongated head fully grown and towering over brett brett turns around and is mesmerized while looking at the creature opening its mouth revealing a second set of teeth which quickly extends from the mouth biting brett in the head and dragging him bloodied and screaming above into an air shaft ripley and parker hear him and arrive just in time to catch a glimpse of the monster as brett disappears and blood drips downparker and ripley can only confirm the creature is big and escaped through the air ducts brett is assumed dead the crew debates their next move they all agree that the alien is using the air shafts to move around so if they could drive it from the ducts into an airlock they might be able to blow it out into space ripley asks ash if he can offer some helpful information as a scientist ash suggests the alien may be afraid of fire as most animals are fortunately there are several flamethrowers on board ripley volunteers to enter the air shafts but dallas overrules her by volunteering himselfdallas enters the mother console once more he tries to get the mother computer to evaluate their procedure to get rid of the alien but mother simply cannot provide an answer due to lack of input he tries to get mother to offer suggestions but again the computer cannot compute due to lack of available data finally dallas types  what are my chances the computer replies that it cannot computethe main airlock is prepared by ripley and ash for the decompression procedure while parker and lambert position themselves where they can measure movement inside the ducts the main duct is opened and dallas enters the network of air shafts with a flamethrower allowing the crew to remoteclose valves behind him as he proceeds lambert uses a motion tracker to get his location when she suddenly catches another signal going towards him assuming it is the alien dallas uses the flamethrower to make sure that one of the ducts leading down is safe he ascends a ladder to the lower duct but the aliens signal is lost in the meanwhile he finds a puddle of slime on the floor lambert assures him that the alien cannot be far so he uses the flame thrower around him to scare it out of hiding nothing is there dallas is disoriented in the cramped space and starts to panic when the other signal starts moving again at higher speed to his location lambert desperately urges him to move away he descends another ladder turning around his light illuminating the shrieking creature stretching its arms towards him static and feedback interrupt the line and then there is only silenceparker puts dallas flamethrower on the table saying it was just laying in the duct no blood no dallas lambert looks as if she is near a nervous breakdown while ripley is desperately trying to hide her apprehension she suggests that in absence of a better idea they should continue with the old plan lambert says it is madness and suggests abandoning the ship with the shuttle however the shuttle cannot sustain four people parker also opposes the idea and wants to kill the creature even if this means entering the entire duct system again and blowing the alien out of the airlock he leaves to refill the flamethrower ripley once again tries to get helpful information from ash but he says he is still analyzing she scoffs at him for being so little help and decides to go and try mother for answers since she now has access in light of dallas absenceripley enters the mother console and queries mother for answers as to why they are unable to neutralize the alien mother responds that she cannot clarify ripley asks mother to explain that mother replies that she cannot referring to special order 937  which is only meant to be read by the science officer ripley uses a command override to force mother to explain what special order 937 entails mother displays the following shocking text nostromo rerouted to new coordinates investigate life form gather specimen priority one insure return of organism for analysis all other considerations secondary crew expendable as she contemplates the cold hard words she suddenly finds ash sitting next to her saying there is an explanation for this furiously she grabs and yells at him sobbing uncontrollably she leaves the console trying to contact parker and lambert but she finds that ash is closing all doors leaving the mess hall preventing her from leaving she demands that he open the doors but ash simply stares at her she notices a drop of white liquid running down his face and he starts to have facial twitches unnerved she tries to run away but he suddenly grabs her hair ripley breaks free pulling out a lock of hair and tries to run ash quickly catches up and throws her against a few walls while she is barely conscious ash uses a rolledup magazine in order to choke her she starts to struggle fiercely as ash starts to twitch and make incoherent noises suddenly parker and lambert arrive both trying to drag ash away from ripley parker howls in pain as ash grabs a piece of skin on his chest forcing him to let go parker quickly grabs a fire extinguisher and hits ash with it in the back ash starts to convulse and shriek violently making very inhuman sounds while spitting out white liquid parker gives him another blow with the extinguisher dislodging ashs head revealing ash is an android he keeps ponding ash until he is on the floor white liquid gushing from its insides ash movements start to decrease and parker settles down but suddenly the decapitated body grabs him and forces him onto a table lambert finally grabs the electric prod and screams as she stabs ash in the back with it finally rendering the android lifelesswith ash disabled ripley theorizes that the company sent him along to bring an alien back for their weapons division as ash was always very protective of the creature they reconnect his disembodied head to see if he can give them any advice on how to deal with the creature ash confirms that his order was to bring back the lifeform even if it meant sacrificing the crew ripley asks how they can kill the creature he tells them they have no chance against it as it is the perfect organism he has a silent admiration for it a survivor unclouded by conscience remorse and delusions of morality when he mocks their chances of survival ripley disconnects him again the three survivors decide to follow lamberts earlier suggestion set the nostromo to selfdestruct and escape in the shuttle leaving the alien to die on the main ship as they leave the room parker turns the flamethrower on ashs corpse melting his remains ripley will prep the shuttle for launch while parker and lambert go to gather coolant for the shuttles lifesupport systemwhile prepping the shuttle ripley hears the cat meowing on the ships open intercom system and realizes jones is still left behind lambert and parker are in the hold gathering equipment they proceed to a small room where the coolant is stored ripley ventures out alone into the hallways of the nostromo to find jones the cat expecting the alien at every turn ripley finally locates the cat in the cockpit where he startles her as he suddenly jumps into view she puts him into his traveling container in the meanwhile parker and lambert are working so feverishly on the supplies that neither of them pays attention to a large shadow creeping into the room it is the alien and it closes in on lambert ripley can hear parker shouting orders to lambert to get out of the way but the alien has cornered her against the wall parker is unable to get a clear shot at it with the flamethrower without killing lambert as it is hulking over her finally he charges at the creature but it rapidly spins whipping the flamethrower out of his hands with its long tail and grabbing him with its large claws the creature opens its mouth and its bizarre inner jaws pierce parkers head instantly killing him as ripley rushes towards their position she is powerless to prevent the creature from turning back to lambert it curls its tail around her and the final thing that ripley can hear from the intercom are the sounds of lambert crying sobbing gagging and screaming ripley finds their lifeless bodies in the storage room they had been working in with no sign of the alienin terrible shock ripley dashes towards the emergency room without stopping between the sobs she quickly completes the entire procedure to activate the selfdestruct mechanism the voice of mother now announces that the selfdestruct mechanism has been activated and the ship will detonate in 10 minutes however the selfdestruct can still be canceled during the first five minutesripley takes a ladder to the lower deck where she hears a soft groan she inspects the hold and finds a strange organic structure adhering to the walls and machinery shocked she finds dallas stuck within the adhesive barely alive on the opposite wall she notices a shape which vaguely resembles brett he seems to be dissolving transforming into an object like the eggs seen in the derelict ship dallas very weakly begs ripley to kill him after some hesitation she grants his dying request she burns them both with the flamethrower and rushes out of the chamberripley crawls up a ladder and runs towards the shuttle with jones in the container she briefly rests against a wall when she suddenly hears the alien stirring around the corner terrified she drops the cat carrier and carefully retraces her steps as the alien slowly comes into view around the corner it shows interest in jones the alien slams the container against a wall ripley races back to selfdestruct mechanism and tries to override the procedure however she is too late as the mechanism is already starting to activate she restarts the cooling unit but mother states that it is too late to stop the countdown and the nostromo will explode in 5 minutes much to ripleys anger with sirens blaring and steam releasing ripley runs back to the shuttle loading area ready to make her best attempt to fight off the alien and get into the lifeboat the alien is nowhere to be seen only the cat container lying on its side as fires start to erupt she picks up jones and boards the shuttle with only one minute to abandon ship she quickly runs through the launch sequence and the shuttle lowers to launch position as mother starts counting down the last 30 seconds of the nostromos life the shuttles engines ignite and the ship races away from the nostromo which grows smaller by the second a series of mighty explosions follow as the nostromo vanishes in fire destroying the refinery and ore it had been carrying ripley is relieved it destroyed the alien along with itripley gives jones an hug and prepares one of the biobeds for cryosleep putting jones in it as she makes final preparations for the ship a hand suddenly reaches out to her from a wall she shrieks and in horror she sees the alien lying in an alcove it had in fact stowed away aboard the shuttle its external physicality making it blend in with the ships machinery she flees into a locker with space suits inside and notices the alien is not following her it remains lying in the alcove seemingly unable to do something ripley gets an idea and dons one of the spacesuits she arms herself with a harpoon gun then straps herself into a chair while singing you are my lucky star to calm her nerves opening a series of air vents above the aliens head ripley tests them one at a time and then finds one that directly blasts highpressure steam onto the alien driving it screaming from its hiding spot as she is activating several buttons she doesnt notice the monster creeping up to her from the side until it is standing next to her to its full menacing 2meter height ready to attack with its inner jaw screaming she opens the shuttles airlock door everything not secured including the alien blasts towards the door the alien however grabs the edges of the doorway to prevent itself from being sucked outside ripley quickly fires her harpoon before the creature is able to haul itself in it pierces the screaming alien which lets go of the doorway and blasts outside the wire connecting the gun to the harpoon pulling the gun out of ripleys hands however the door slams shut jamming the wire under it still tethered to the door by the wire the alien undauntedly attempts to reenter the ship by climbing inside one of the heat thrusters ripley however sees the opportunity and fires the engines incinerating the alien and sending it drifting into spacebefore she and jones enter hypersleep for the trip home ripley records a final log entry stating that kane lambert parker brett ash and captain dallas are dead cargo and ship are destroyed she expects to reach the frontier in six weeks and to be picked up by the network she signs off as ripley last survivor of the nostromo and gets into hypersleepend credits 8.5spaceship egg warning
