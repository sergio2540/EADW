denise snider patrick veverka chris wretzak john hartman two junior executives on a six week business trip both of whom have been recently hurt by women devise a horrible plan to get even with women for their past hurts they intend to find romance and then dump a vulnerable woman they choose cristine and for a while all goes according to plan however it soon becomes clear that things are not as simple as they think the executives chad and howard have just been rejected by their mates while traveling for a six weeks temporary assignment in another office they plot an evil game to get even with women they plan to seduce a vulnerable woman and dump her with her feelings and selfesteem completely destroyed when they meet the deaf secretary cristine they find their perfect victim however things get complicated when howard falls in love for cristina set in an unnamed midwestern american city chad aaron eckhart and howard matt malloy are two middle management employees at a corporation temporarily assigned to a branch office away from their home city for several weeks howard is assigned to head up the new project and chad is to assist after their first meeting at the local airport and after having dinner and drinks they talk about the history about their failed relationships embittered by bad experiences with women they form a meanspirited revenge scheme to find an insecure woman romance her simultaneously and then break up with her at the same time chad who is cruel manipulative duplicitous misogynist and abusive to his subordinates and coworkers is the originator and driving force behind the scheme while howard is the more passive of the two which leads to a later conflict with the schemechad decides upon christine stacey edwards a deaf coworker who is so selfconscious that she wears headphones so people thinking that she is listening to music are compelled to get her attention visually or tactilely without immediately learning that she is deaf chad and howard decide to each ask her out and out of her lonelienss she accepts over the course of several weeks both of them date her simultaneouslyin the meantime things with the project go wrong a fax chad is supposed to have sent to the home office is lost and a presentation chad is supposed to deliver to the home office is unable to be carried out successfully after some documents are allegedly printed so lightly that they are illegible these mishaps culminate in howard being demoted and chad taking his place at the head of the project after he places the blame for most of the mishaps on the unknowing and nebbish howardchad eventually sleeps with chistine and she falls in love with him when christine eventually breaks this news to howard that shes dating his coworker chad howard tells christine the truth about their scheme and tells her that he loves her christine is shocked by the revelation and refuses to believe that chad would do this when she confronts chad he admits the truth christine angrily slaps chad but he is so unashamed of his behavior and cruelly taunts christine who collapses into tears after he leaves herseveral weeks later howard confronts chad back home at his apartment howard is now apparently in the bad graces of the company being moved to a lower floor while chad is doing well chad offers to go to higher managerment to say something on howards behalf nevertheless howard is not worried about work he confesses to chad that he really loved christine and feels ashamed at what they did to her at this point chad despite having previously told howard that his girlfriend suzanne had left him shows howard that she is still there asleep in his bed chad says that he carried out the entire plan because i could and he asks howard how it feels to have truly hurt someonehoward who had never done anything like that before leaves horrified and angry that chad used him just so he could steal his promotion as well as hurt an innocent woman just for the hell of it and now has completely gotten away with ithoward travels back to the nameless city and to a local bank where he sees christine now working as a clerk howard tries to speak to her but she ignores him he loudly pleads with her to listen to him but his pleas literally fall on deaf ears 7.3love revenge business-trip misogynist office secretary dialogue-driven men's-bathroom model-airplane
