suspicious look worried that she has been found out already she still proceeds out of town on her way to fairvale california where sam lives all the while she keeps looking behind her fearful that shes being followed she drives well into the night and parks alongside the road to sleepin the morning a highway patrolman mort mills stops to investigate her stopped car and awakens her startled and nervous she arouses the patrolmans suspicions he looks at her license and registration taking note of the plate number he allows her to go on but follows her for a while which intensifies marions agitationrealizing that her car can easily give her away marion decides to trade it in for a different car she stops in at a used car lot hurriedly pays the salesman john anderson 700 cash for a likely substitute and completes the deal as the same highway patrolman watches from across the street nervous she drives away and continues toward fairvaleas night falls on this second night with her fears of pursuit crowding in around her she drives into a rainstorm unable to see the road clearly she spots the lighted sign of the bates motel and decides to take a room for the night as there are no other cars there and no one in the motel office she honks her horn upon seeing a light on in the house behind the motel and a silhouette in the window a young man soon comes down the path to greet her and he introduces himself as norman bates anthony perkins he is a softspoken and shy young man who tells marion that he lives in the large house with his mother the motel seldom has guests anymore since the new interstate bypassed the local highway and marion realizes that she probably took a wrong turn in the storm still nervous about being tracked by the police marion registers under a false name and norman checks her into cabin 1 just next to the office when she asks about food marion learns that fairvale is only fifteen miles awaynorman offers to share his supper with her so she doesnt have to go out again in the rain and he goes back to the house she begins unpacking taking time to repack the money inside a newspaper which she sets aside on the bed table then she overhears a shouted argument between norman and his mother coming from the house mother bates seems to have a low opinion of beautiful young women and doesnt want norman associating with them he brings sandwiches and milk back to the office where marion joins him in the parlor just behind the checkin deskmarion is taken aback by normans stuffed birds that fill the parlor a product of his taxidermy hobby in their conversation over sandwiches norman talks about being trapped just as marion presently feels trapped by her guilt norman is more permanently trapped in his coexistence with his mother and her madness but as norman observes we all go a little mad sometimes taking normans situation as a cautionary tale marion decides to return to phoenix to make amends and try to pull herself out of the trap shes gotten herself into before its too latewhen marion goes back to her room norman takes down a picture from the wall and looks through a peephole where he can watch marion changing with a new burst of intensity norman hurries up the hill and goes into the housein her room marion sits in her robe and calculates some figures working out how she can repay the 700 she has already spent then she tears up the paper containing the figures and flushes the pieces down the toilet with newfound peace of mind she slips out of her robe and slippers and steps into the tub to enjoy a cleansing showerunseen behind her the bathroom door opens a figure approaches and pulls back the shower curtain it is the shadowy figure of an old woman wielding a large kitchen knife marion screams the blade lifts high into the air and then strikes and strikes again and again marion cannot escape the slicing blows of the knife the savage attack continues over and over again and then her killer leaves the job done marion sinks down reaching for the shower curtain which rips down around her and she falls over the edge of the tub the shower continues to run over her and her diluted lifeblood flows away down the tub drain her lifeless eyes fixed in a final hopeless starefrom the house normans voice yells out in shock mother oh god mother blood blood he comes running down the hill and into marions cabin to find the aftermath of mothers knife attack he quickly cleans up the murder scene he wraps marions body in the shower curtain and places her in the trunk of her car and gathers her belongings into the trunk as well at the last moment he spots the newspaper on the bed table and tosses it into the trunk not knowing that it contains the stolen money he drives to a swamp near the motel where he pushes the car in and watches it slowly disappear into the dark bogone week later sam loomis is sitting in the back office of his hardware store in fairvale writing a note to marion he has changed his mind and if its not too late he wants to marry her right away even if his finances are limited right now marions sister lila crane vera miles comes into the store and asks if marion is there sam tells her she isnt a private investigator named arbogast martin balsam also enters the store and asks for marions whereabouts his interest is in recovering the stolen 40000 which lila knew about but sam did not arbogast is convinced that marion is somewhere in this town close to her boyfriend so he sets out on a search of hotels and boarding houses around fairvale to track her downwhen arbogast gets to the bates motel norman tells him he hasnt seen marion and that there havent been any guests in weeks but arbogast manages to look at the register and sees the false signature in marions handwriting caught in his lie that here hadnt been any recent guests norman admits to remembering her now and says she stayed that saturday night and left early on sunday morning arbogast spots mothers silhouette sitting at the window of the house and asks to see her but norman refuses saying that his mother is an invalid and shouldnt be disturbed when norman lets slip his mothers impressions of marion arbogast becomes determined to talk to her but norman insists that he leavearbogast phones sam and lila to tell them that marion had registered the previous saturday night at the bates motel in cabin 1 and that he means to sneak back and talk to mrs bates regardless of normans objections when he gets back to the motel arbogast looks into the office and the parlor briefly to see if norman is there and takes a quick look into the motel safe which is standing open then he heads up to the house and goes inside sensing that no one is downstairs he starts up the stairs as he nears the top of the stairs mother bates emerges from the bedroom and stabs him he stumbles backwards down the stairs and falls to the floor where he is set upon and stabbed yet againat the hardware store lila and sam have been waiting for arbogast and they are now out of patience they expected arbogast to be back three hours ago so they decide to look for him sam tells lila to stay behind while he goes out to the motel when he gets there he calls out but no one answers norman standing by the swamp hears sam call out for arbogastsam returns to the store having seen no one at the motel or the house no arbogast no bates only a sick old lady unable or unwilling to answer the door sam suggests they go see sheriff chambers john mcintire to report the missing arbogast at the sheriffs house chambers and his wife lurene tuttle listen to sam and lila tell their story at their urging chambers phones the motel and talks to norman who says that the detective had been there but had left when lila presses chambers about the mother chambers tells them that normans mother has been dead and buried for the past ten years having poisoned her lover and herself in the only murdersuicide in fairvales living memory but sam and lila insist that there is an old woman out there and that arbogast had told them that norman wouldnt let arbogast see his mother because she was too ill that makes the sheriff wonder if normans mother is up there at the motel then who is buried in that grave in green lawn cemeterynorman is worried about all the people who have been snooping around his concerns lead to another unseen argument with mother in which he tells her she should hide in the fruit cellar for a few days she refuses norman says he will pick her up and carry her downstairs she berates him and insists she could walk if she wanted to but she doesnt want to in spite of mothers protests norman carries his mother down the stairsthe next morning sunday morning lila and sam meet sheriff and mrs chambers coming out of church the sheriff has already been to the motel before church services norman is alone out there he says he saw the whole place the detective has probably just moved on to pursue a lead without telling them he suggests that lila report a missing person and a theft and let the law find her sister and with that the chambers go their way unsatisfied lila and sam decide to go out to the motel for themselves their plan is to register as husband and wife and check into a cabin then they will search every inch of the place inside and outnorman assigns them to cabin 10 and sam insists on signing the register as he pays and asks norman for a receipt lila takes the key and goes ahead toward their cabin on the way she checks that the door to cabin 1 is unlocked after a brief stop in cabin 10 to talk matters over and after they are sure norman is not nearby sam and lila enter cabin 1 to search for clues the only thing they can find is a scrap of paper with something subtracted from 40000 proving marion had been there but that was never in doubt lila wants to talk to the old woman because she must have told arbogast something she wants sam to distract norman while she goes to the house sam tries to dissuade her but she insists she can handle a sick old womansam finds norman in the office and starts talking with him while lila circles around behind the motel to the house she goes in and looks through all the rooms upstairs she goes into mothers bedroom a scene of oldfashioned lavishness gone to ruin the outline of the womans body is deeply impressed into the old mattress she looks into normans bedroom a little boys room frozen in timemeanwhile sam has been trying to get norman to talk about money looking for some indication that norman has the stolen cash norman begins to grow agitated when sam suggests that normans mother might know something about the 40000 norman begins to realize that his other guest may be snooping around at the house sam tries to keep norman from leaving and they struggle norman knocks sam over the head and sam falls dazed to the floorlila is just coming down the stairs when she sees norman running toward the front door she ducks around behind the stairs and partway down the cellar steps to avoid him norman heads upstairs lila starts to come back up when she notices the cellar door at the bottom of the steps this is a room she hasnt examined yet and she risks the opportunity to look into itwalking through a storage room and into the barren fruit cellar beyond it she sees an old woman sitting in a chair facing the far wall she whispers mrs bates but the woman doesnt respond she taps the woman on the shoulder the chair swivels around to reveal the desiccated remains of an old womans corpse her face contorted into a nearskeletal grin and seemingly staring out of eyeless socketslila screams and turns away and her flinching reaction sets the bare hanging light bulb to swinging at that moment the living semblance of an old woman enters at the door wielding a large knife blocking the only escape route from the cellar in the next moment sams timely arrival saves lila as he subdues the wouldbe assailant from behind the womans wig falls away to reveal norman bates dressed in the guise of his motherlila sam and sheriff chambers are among a bewildered group of interested persons who sit in an office in the county court house waiting to hear from a psychiatrist who has been called in to examine norman the psychiatrist simon oakland enters to tell them he has gotten the whole story but not from norman he got it from normans mother as a personality norman no longer exists the other half the mother half of normans mind has taken over probably for all timeyears ago he tells them after the disturbing death of normans father norman came to depend on the undivided attention of his mother but when she took a lover the already deranged norman felt as if he had been replaced his jealousy could not stand to share her so he poisoned both his mother and her lover instead of letting her be buried he stole the corpse and treated it to preserve it as best he couldhis crime of matricide overwhelmed his already fragile mind and he began to divide his mind with his mother to give her back part of the life he had stolen from her he went to great lengths to preserve the illusion that she was still alive so that he could deny to himself that he had killed her he began to think and speak for her he walked around wearing her clothes and a womans wig to further enhance the illusion at times he could be both personalities and carry on both sides of conversations other times the mother half the dominant half took over completely he was never all norman but he was often only motherand because he was so pathologically jealous of her he assumed she was just as jealous of him and would not let him be attracted to other women when norman met marion he felt a strong attraction to her that attraction set off the jealous mother and it was mother who killed marion the latest in a series of young women to meet a similar fate afterwards norman would return as if from a sleep and dutifully clean up after mothers crimes sinking all evidence into the swamp near the motel but now it looks as if mother has won the inevitable battle that always develops between multiple personalities and has driven norman out completelyin a locked and guarded room the physical shell of norman bates sits unmoving as mothers thoughts dominate the mind free of normans mental presence she regrets that she had to condemn her own son but she couldnt let him say that she had killed those people as if she could commit murder as if she could do anything except just sit and stare she knows they must be watching her but shell show them what kind of person she is she wont move a muscle she wont even swat that fly then theyll see theyll say why she wouldnt even harm a fly and with that she stares ahead motionlessly as her face contorts into a nearskeletal grinin a final image a tow chain begins pulling marions car out of the bogend of film 8.6motel money california shower alimony phoenix arizona
