be gone as soon as his car is fixedbobby goes back to the mechanic where he finds that darrell has done additional work and is asking a higher price he also busted open the trunk of the car and has taken bobbys gun a confrontation breaks out which results in darrell scratching up the hood of bobbys car darrell says that he will continue working on the car and charging more and more for the work until bobby has the means to pay him darrell refuses to take any payment other then cashwondering what to do for money bobby remembers the offer jake made to him earlier in the car he approaches jake about the deal who initially passes the comment off as a joke bobby says that he could tell jake was serious about the offer and that he is serious about taking him up on it jake tells him that he would need to take grace out of town and push her off a cliff in order to make the murder look like a suicidea dream sequence shows that bobby couldnt go through with it and ends up having sex with her instead as it cuts back into the real world grace cuts the sex short however just before he comes leading bobby to call her the queen of hotandcold grace reveals that she is not just jakes wife she is also his illegitimate child jake sexually abused her from a young age and then married her after her mother died her mother was found dead at the bottom of a cliff but her death was ruled a suicide grace doesnt believe she killed herself her death is eerily similar to how jake told bobby to kill grace grace then asks bobby if he would kill jake meaning the two of them could steal his money which grace would not have access to otherwise bobby initially refuses clearly not trusting gracestill broke and aware that the gangsters will send someone to find him bobby attempts to buy a ticket out of town in order to escape although he doesnt have enough money the clerk gives him the ticket anyway after he becomes aggressive and hostile after buying the ticket he sees one of the gangsters driving towards him however the sheriff stops the gangster and arrests him for speeding thinking he is safe bobby is then attacked by tnt who has been attempting to fight him for most of the film tnt takes bobbys ticket rips it up and eats it causing bobby to lose his temper and badly beats him up just then jenny appears and yells at bobby to stop beating up her boyfriend  bobby reacts with disbelief as jenny having just been beaten and punched in the face by tnt minutes earlier is now comforting him bobby angrily storms out of the bus station seeing how crazy not only jenny is but the entire town isknowing he is out of options bobby phones grace and agrees with her plan to kill jake for his money she instructs him to come on over to the house after dark for the deed to be done that evening after the sun sets bobby breaks into jakes house while jake is having sex with grace but bobby accidentally makes a noise jake goes downstairs to investigate and finds bobby who then tells jake that killing him was graces idea and that hell kill grace for just enough money to pay for a car grace overhears this and attacks bobby when he walks into the room however she is really waiting for jake to return so that she can kill him after killing jake bobby and grace unlock his safe to find 200000 in cash they then have sex in front of his dead bodythe next morning bobby goes to darrell to pay him and finally gets his car back when bobby returns to the house graces car is gone bobby thinks she has run off with the all the money but she shows up at the front door as they drive off and out of town however they are pulled over by sheriff potter here we find out that grace has also been sleeping with him grace appears to turn on bobby blaming him for jakes death and telling the sheriff that bobby just killed her husband however just as sheriff potter places bobby under arrest she pulls out her gun and shoots the sheriff dead bobby helps grace put the sheriff in the car trunk with jakeas bobby and grace are dumping the two bodies off a cliff bobby elbows grace in the nose and takes her gun telling her that he does not trust her and that when they reach california they will split the money and go their separate ways grace says that when she blamed jakes death on bobby she was merely baiting the sheriff so she could kill him much like bobby baited jake when he said he would kill grace the implication seems to be that bobby would have killed grace rather than jake if hed had to as they are talking grace suddenly pushes bobby over the cliff not killing him but severely injuring him grace smirks and tells bobby laying at the bottom of the 60foot cliff that his suspisions about her were correct she really is too greedy to split the money in any way and she used him so she could steal all of jakes money for herself she also tells bobby that she was the one who killed her mother by pushing her off the very same cliff for reasons not made clearas grace gets back in the car to drive off she realizes that bobby has taken the keys bobby pleads with her to come down and help him she does so knowing she needs the keys when she gets close enough however he strangles her to death with his bare hands grace manages to shoot bobby with her gun before she expires but it is a nonfatal wound to his right hip bobby then makes the grueling journey back up the cliff with a broken leg a broken arm his gunshot wound and several other serious and superficial injuries relieved that he is finally back in his car and with all the money he starts the car to drive off only for the radiator hose to burst again like it did in the opening scene bobby sits back and laughs insanely of his continuing bad luck as he looks up at the bright blue sky aware that he will probally die in the desert heat without anyone to help him now 6.8desert money arizona drifter small town debt disposing of a dead body language barrier body in a trunk axe murder falling off a cliff
