nell looks in the mirror and spees speaks to her deceased twin sister mae mary and dreams of running through the forest  playing with her when they were young memories of mae seem to be a great comfort to nell
the female psychologist that dr lovell had come out to observe nell wants to study her in a laboratory setting and her boss a noted psychiatrist pushes for this to happen but dr lovell objects  at court a judge decides to give 3 months for observation of nell in her own surroundings to see if she is competent to give informed consent to be studied
as dr lovell who moves into a tent a short distance from nells forest cabin begins to interact with nellshe subsequently comes to trust him and refers to him as her gahanj later lovell determines this to mean guardian angel and calls him jay in her way of saying jerry
the psychologist paula olsen has also come out to observe living in a labfunded houseboat she has sneaked in and put a video camera in nells cabin so she can watch her without the personal interaction its unclear if this the sole intent or if it is just easier to do this way
eventually outsiders inadvertently learn of nell  a journalist makes his way to nells cabin  frightens her with his flash photography which nell has never seen of course jerry runs him off but a story comes out in the newspaper  soon a helicopter arrives frightening nell to the point of collapse in an effort to shield her from gratuitous exposure to ruthless media paula who now sees nell as a real person who is sweet  needs no state intervention and jerry decide the only place she can be safe from the press is at the hospital where paulas boss wants to make a lab rat out of her
the arrival at the scary hospital along with the traumatic fleeing from media helicopter shocks nell into a catatonic state which both doctors know will send her directly to an institution when her 3month evaluation comes up jerry impulsively breaks out of the hospital with nell  holes up in a hotel where she continues to refuse to speak or interact with him at one point nell is alone on the balcony outside the hotel room door looking down into the neglected pool and daydreams of mae this scene seems to imply that nell is suicidal but that is never made clear
finally at the competency hearing jerry becomes frustrated at how nell is being railroaded knowing how she really is and nell suddenly comes alive and seems to come to jerrys defense by basically explaining herself asking jerry to spee fo nell the things she says and emotions she expresses are very beautiful  the movie ends with jerry  paula driving with their young daughter to a gathering of some sort at nells cabin where there are quite a few other people including the sheriff and his wife who are fond of nell throughout the film as well nell has a scene with the young daughter teaching her the chant she and mae used to say and telling her you member dat
i love this movie even if it is a bit farfetched the scenery is breathtaking and the emotions are beautiful  ultimately the moral leave well enough alone is appealing to me 6.5twin psychology forest isolation death north-carolina cabin topless-female-nudity popcorn nudity bare-breasts rape mirror idioglossia bible female-full-frontal-nudity twin-speech mother-daughter-relationship sister-sister-relationship made-up-language solitude camera-focus-on-female-butt wild-girl nature friendship psychiatry female-nudity innocence-lost lake baby-food religion autism based-on-play character-name-in-title
