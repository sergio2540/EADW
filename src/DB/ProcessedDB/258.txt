russell sanderlin sr frank silva richard allen waite delaney williams gregory l williams walter winchell astronomer dr ellie arroway has long been interested in contact to faraway lands a love fostered in her childhood by her father ted arroway who passed away when she was nine years old leaving her then orphaned her current work in monitoring for extraterrestrial life is based on that love and is in part an homage to her father ever since funding from the national science foundation nsf was pulled on her work which is referred to some including her nsf superior david drumlin as more science fiction than science ellie with a few of her rogue scientist colleagues have looked for funding from where ever they could get it to continue their work when ellie and her colleagues hear chatter originating from the vicinity of the star vega ellie feels vindicated but that vindication is short lived when others including politicians the military religious leaders and other scientists such as drumlin try to take over her work when the messages received from space are decoded the project takes on a whole new dimension which strengthens for ellie the quest for the truth thrown into the mix are the unknown person who has up until now funded most of ellies work and what his motivations are and palmer joss a renowned author and theologian who despite their fundamental differences in outlook is mutually attracted to ellie that attraction based in part on intellect and their common goal of wanting to know the truth the skeptical scientist dr ellie arroway researches extraterrestrial life with her team in puerto rico when david drumlin tom skerritt shutsdown the project ellie seeks for private funds to reopen her research in new mexico an anonymous millionaire provides the necessary funds and ellie proceeds with her work four years later she is contacted by alien forms from vega that send a coded message the millionaire sr hadden that is financing the research deciphers the message and gives to ellie the design of an intriguing machine ellie concludes that the equipment might be to transport a passenger to vega now she needs to convince a commission formed by military politicians scientists and religious leaders that she is the best candidate for the journey contact is the story of a free thinking radio astronomer who discovers an intelligent signal broadcast from deep space she and her fellow scientists are able to decipher the message and discover detailed instructions for building a mysterious machine will the machine spell the end of our world or the end of our superstitions will we take our place among the races of the galaxy or are we just an upstart species with a long way to go dr eleanor arroway has spent her life searching for truth in the study of radio astronomy palmer joss has spent his searching for truth through faith in god when ellie discovers a stunning message from an extraterrestrial intelligence they and everyone on earth will be forced to challenge their own assumptions in the inevitable first contact will humankind be able to find a compromise between science and belief the film opens with a shot of earth from space and an audio track of various samples of recognizable mass communications from world history the shot suddenly begins to travel outwards from earth at impossible speed passing mars the asteroid belt of the solar system passing jupiter travelling through saturns rings and leaving our solar system travel continues even faster seemingly faster than light passing the pillars of creation in the eagle nebula and out of the milky way galaxy the trip passes through another galaxy finally showing us a field of thousands of galaxies after a few moments we pass through the iris of a young girl ellie arroway who is reciting a ham radio greeting cq seek you in her bedroomellie has a gift for science and is encouraged by her kindly father to communicate with people in distant cities on her ham ellie makes contact with someone in pensacola florida her longest communication yet at over a thousand miles from her home near madison wisconsin that night ellie asks if she could ever have a transmitter powerful enough to talk to her deceased mother who died in childbirth her father says he doesnt know but suggests that ellie is tenacious enough that she probably could accomplish such a task one dayellies father dies one night while they stargaze ellie seems to blame herself for not getting her father his heart medication in time ellie grows up to become a brilliant astrophysicist earns her doctorate and begins her research with seti search for extraterrestrial intelligence institute at arecibo in puerto ricoat arecibo ellie meets influential spiritual ponderer palmer joss matthew mcconaughey and has an intense brief but detached on her part affair with him one day while looking in a cracker jack box he finds a toy compass and gives it to her so she wont lose her way palmer wants to get closer to ellie in terms of a relationship but ellie is more preoccupied with her search for extraterrestrial life shortly after ellie is angered when drumlin pulls her teams funding she gets in a heated debate defending her work to which drumlin chastises her for spending time on nonsensetaking action ellie and her team pool together to try and get funding for their project from private sources ellie and her team spend 18 months searching before finding their benefactor in the form of s r hadden john hurt a billionaire investor who had been known for innovation and had fallen out of favor in the scientific community haddens funding allows ellie to have access to the very large array vla in new mexico a facility with 27 large radio antenna dishes which ellie uses to continue her search even here drumlin and the scientific community are not far behind with 4 years of finding nothing and even though all funding for the project is privatized by hadden industries and because of ellies relentless pursuit and reputation for bizarre experiments the project is still in danger of being shut down by drumlin again even so ellie vows not to quitone evening while listening intently ellie hears a powerful signal a prime number pattern emanating from the star vega confirmed by others the world over undeniable and strong in its pulsing power other astronomers in worldwide countries are utilized to record the signal since the vla is only aligned to vega for a certain amount of time shortly thereafter drumlin inserts himself into the situation taking credit for ellies work ellie is also pressured by the presidents national security adviser michael kitz james woods who wishes to militarize the project feeling that due to other countries having heard the message ellie has compromised national security even though the message was not specifically usaonly in naturekitz and his assistant rachel constantine angela bassett inform the president when a video feed of hitler is found mixed into the prime number pulse pattern it is from the 1936 olympics the first television signal strong enough to leave the atmosphere but the implications are threatening is the alien intelligence seeing a friend in hitler or merely bouncing the signal back to earth religious right mouthpiece richard rank rob lowe reports that the fundamentalist camp is wary at the same time huge crowds of people descend on the vla compound in new mexico trying to hear the signal some come for support others such as a religious zealot named joseph jake busey have come to condemn ellie and the others preaching against sciencea short time later it is found that interlaced within the signal are a number of pages of digital data over 60000 in total ellie is then given authority over the deciphering but after many months the edges of the pages do not seem capable of lining up ellie soon gets her answer in the form of hadden himself who meets with ellie privately he then explains that ellie and her team had been deciphering the pages in only two dimensions the pages it seems were created in three dimensions with this revelation ellie is able to find the primer or the key to decoding the aliens message within the pages there appear to be some form of blueprints while ellie speculates they could be a transport kitz and his security detail feel it could be a weapon of some kind falling back on speculation that any alien life forms would be hostile to mankindthe decryption team is able to determine that the plans are indeed for a type of transport and contain an image of a humanlike figure construction of the machine is estimated to cost as much as about 300 billion dollars with a number of countries vying for the ability to join in construction or to have a representative from their country vie for the chance to travel in the machinea special panel is convened to select the appropriate candidate for the trip ellie is surprised when drumlin resigns his post to become a candidate ellie is also a candidate and makes it to the final round for deciding who will go palmer who is on the panel cripples ellies chances of being selected by asking her if she believes in god ellie indirectly answers the question by not stating a direct answer her falter is then picked up by drumlin who then speaks passionately using god in his closing remarks his grandstanding attitude towards the panel works and he is chosen to go ellie feels betrayed by palmer who states that he couldnt choose someone who doesnt believe in god ellie angrily tells him that she told the truth whereas drumlin just told them what they wanted to hear she then returns the compass he gave herafter a few years of construction the machine is completed at cape canaveral and its testrun is televised on all major news networks while drumlin is supervising the test from the machine ellie is allowed to be part of the tests control team at nasas mission control all seems to be going well in testing until joseph who ellie had seen previously preaching against the project at the vla in new mexico is spotted on security cameras in the machines gantry with explosives strapped to his chest drumlin and a number of men try to subdue him but joseph detonates the explosives destroying the machine and those conducting the test inside the machine including drumlin ellie then returns to the vla saddened that her discovery or any chance of making contact appears to have been destroyed that evening she is surprised to find a satellite uplink in her apartment the uplink connects her to the mir space station which has now become home to sr hadden as a way to try and slow the terminal cancer that is eating him alive happily hadden shows ellie that his company had secretly constructed a second machine in secret on hokkaido island and that he wants her to take the trip this timeellie is flown to a special ship off hokkaido where she is met by the machines crew and given a preflight rundown showing her everything from survival gear to a suicide pill in case she is marooned in space shortly before the trip she is reunited with palmer who returns her compass that she gave him during their last meeting he then reveals that he has come to care about her and that previously he hadnt wanted her to go fearing she might not ever returnellie is then put into the transport pod and after it is launched into the center of the machine she appears to travel through several wormholes seeing bits of alien machinery and a city on a distant planet of some kind at one point ellie separates herself from the restraint chair in the pod to retrieve palmers compass which had come loose from her neck the chair breaks violently apart from its fastenings fulfilling palmers prediction that the compass would one day save her life as ellie stares through a wall of the pod its translucency reveals a brilliant celestial event before she realizes it she is transported to a sandy beach environment similar to the one she drew of pensacola as a little girl suddenly she notices a shimmering image moving towards her as it draws near she is shocked to see that it is her fatherhowever she soon determines that everything the beach the image of her father is not real but memories and thoughts taken from her mind by the alien who has taken on the guise of her father he explains that this was a way to allow them to make things more comfortable for her the alien reveals that the broadcast signal from the 1936 olympics was how the aliens knew about earth and that there are many others out in space when ellie asks about the transport system the alien explains that their race found it but they have no idea who built it the alien explains that in examining her memories that humans feel so alone but to the aliens the one thing theyve found that brings them comfort is each otherthe alien explains that ellie has to go home however she tries to ask more questions but is told by the alien that she has taken the first step and in time mankind will make another and find out more thats the way its been done for billions of years he explainsellie then seemingly lands on the floor of the pod back on earth asking to know how long she was gone she is shocked when everyone tells her that the pod just dropped straight through the machine a number of video footage confirms this and a video recorder that was in her communications headpiece only recorded staticafter these events kitz resigns from his post as national security adviser and holds an inquiry to find out what really happened during the inquiry kitz assumes that the entire event was a hoax from the alien message to the construction blueprints his feelings are that it was all a scheme perpetrated by sr hadden maybe in some crazed idea to unite the world hadden is unable to be presented to the panel as he has since died onboard mir finally succumbing to cancer even with kitz demanding answers ellie explains that without any evidence or proof she firmly believes that she did travel to vega and that she did experience the meeting with the other being the hearing ends and palmer is there to accompany her outside the capitol building in washington a number of people are there many in support of ellies theory as she is put into a car palmer is asked his opinion stating that since he is a man of faith he is bound by a different covenant than ellie but even so he does state that he believes herin the aftermath of the inquiry kitz is in a discussion with rachel constantine after discussing the investigation committees findings rachel explains to kitz how it appears that he overlooked the portion of the report regarding ellies video recorder while kitz said that it had just recorded static rachel has discovered in the report that it actually recorded 18 hours of static the precise amount of time ellie believed her journey had takenellie is shortly thereafter given a grant to continue her work she gives a group of grade school students a tour of the vla facility when one of them asks her if there could be life in outer space she echoes her fathers sentiment from when she was young if there isnt then itd be an awful waste of spacethe ending of the film cuts to some time later on ellie is still working at the vla and even more dishes are being built to allow the team to search further into spacea dedication of the movie to the late astronomer carl sagan precedes the closing credits 7.4alien scientist science radio vega research
