island prison of chateau dif for 13 years where he plots revenge against those who betrayed him with the help of another prisoner he escapes the island and proceeds to transform himself into the wealthy count of monte cristo as part of his plan to exact revenge in the turbulent days in which france was transitioning away from napoleonic rule edmond dantes caviezel and his closest friend fernand mondego pearce aspire to gain the same two things the next captaincy of a ship in morels godfrey marseillebased shipping business and the hands of the lovely mercedes iguanada dominczykdantes and mondego are diverted to elba on a shipping mission because their captain requires medical attention assistance comes unexpectedly in the form of the personal physician of the exiled napoleon norton in return for the use of his doctor napoleon demands that dantes deliver a letter for him and that the mission and the letter be kept a secret unknown to the illiterate dantes the letter will provide bonapartists in marseille information of pertinence to a possible rescue of napoleon also unknown to him fernand has discovered and read the letter and has full knowledge of its contentson his return to france dantes fortunes peak as morel names him captain of one of his ships and an improved station in life prompts edmond to propose to mercedes who accepts the offer in the process of being beaten out of the two things that matter most to him in life the jealous fernand knows that the letter dantes is carrying can be used to falsely implicate him in an act that might be viewed by local authorities as treasonous fernand and his confidant shipping colleague danglars woodington betray dantes by making the magistrate villefort frain aware of the letterdantes is taken by local authorities in front of villefort despite his determination that dantes is innocent of any crime he becomes edgy upon learning that the letter was addressed to noirtier villefort a known bonpartist and consequently a politically inconvenient father for a young man aspiring to a prominent law career in postnapoleonic france to eliminate all evidence that his father was involved in plans for an escape attempt by napoleon from elba villefort burns the letter and has dantes arrested and taken to the chateau dif a maximum security prison where dantes rots for over a decade with no prospects of getting out in the imaginable futuredantes befriends a fellow prisoner named abbe faria harris who is a great scholar and who very gradually transforms the unworldly dantes into a wise learned and cultivated man faria is an old man however and when he comes to realize that he is fatally ill he tells dantes of a great treasure and where it is buriedsecretly placing himself in farias burial sack which is to be thrown over the cliffs and into the river alongside the prison dantes manages to escape after a dangerous ordeal in which he mingles with but ultimately befriends an enterprising yet violent group of smugglers led by luigi vampa blanc he makes his way back to marseille dantes now turns his attention to claiming the treasure abbe faria had referred toafter locating the treasure dantes riches are suddenly boundless but rather than retiring to a life of leisure his new raison detre is vengeance with the objects of his revenge being fernand now a count danglars now a baron and villefort now a chief prosecutor all of whom live in paris as they are now members of parisian high society dantes realizes that to gain access to them hell need to reinvent himself and uses some of his newfound riches to purchase a huge estate near paris he then proclaims himself to be the count of monte cristo and although nobody knows of him his claim is very credible in view of his visibly substantial wealththe count plans a party at his new estate and invites many members of parisian high society including all the objects of his vengeance now having considerable access to each of them one at a time he successfully sets them up for failure danglars is tricked into an act of embezzlement and villefort is tricked into confessing to conspiracy to have his own father murdered within earshot of local authoritiesthe count gains close access to fernand and mercedes who are now husband and wife by paying the smuggler luigi vampa to pretend to kidnap their son albert this enables the count himself to save albert having saved their son the count is now welcome in the home of fernand and mercedestaking note of his mannerisms mercedes soon works out that the count is actually edmond dantes but the count still has a bone to pick with her as she married fernand very shortly after his arrest and had fernands son albert cavill not long after that this seemed a sign of her infidelity but the count ultimately learns that villefort had announced that dantes was dead shortly after the onset of his imprisonment fernand it turns out had bargained for this announcement from which he hoped to gain the hand of mercedes by murdering at villeforts request villeforts father now understanding that mercedes had believed him dead the count is less incensed by her marriage to fernand but still finds the very short period of time between his imprisonment and their marriage very unsettlingthe count is about to turn his back completely on mercedes but then fernands financial ruin from compulsive gambling compels him to leave paris to evade his debtors against whom he has committed crimes unwilling to follow fernand with their son mercedes finally tells the count the truth  she had married fernand because she had unknown to the count been impregnated by dantes shortly before he was arrested she wanted albert to have a father in truth however alberts biological father is the count himselffinally willing to forgive her the count falls in love all over again with mercedes and with those who had betrayed them out of the way they resolve to live their lives casting aside the dark and regrettable episodes which had robbed them of so many happy times with each other and with their son albert 7.7revenge island escape count sailor treason prison treasure best-friend
