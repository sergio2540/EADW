comes there to confront them but he is attracted to lola the next night he comes againand does not sleep at home this causes trouble at work and his life takes a downward spiral it should first be mentioned that there was an englishlanguage version of the film shot simultaneously with the germanlanguage version both versions are nearly identical but there are a few exceptions in the story due to the classic nature of the film this synopsis is based on the original german version of the filmthe film opens with the sound of geese and chickens clucking in a street marketplace a woman washes a window outside a shop featuring a poster of lola marlene dietrich which causes the woman to pose in a similar fashion a shot of a door which reads prof rath introduces the other main character professor immanuel rath emil jannings who is preparing for class a bell is heard ringing in the background as teenage schoolboys run to class the caretaker of the house is cleaning up the house as she reminds the professor of breakfast the professor enters and has some tea coffee and begins to whistle to his bird when he doesnt hear a reply he checks on the bird only to find it has died this seems to sadden the professor which is contrasted by the housekeeper taking the bird and dumping it in an open boiler all she can say is anyway he stopped singing long ago the professor goes on with his breakfastwe are then introduced to his class which is mostly composed of boys gathering in a group to look at a postcard while one boy wipes a blackboard the boy holding the card is blowing on it to make it react in a particular fashion that will be shown later one boy sneaks up to the desk and takes the professors notebook and alters it to say prof garbage an easy pun in german involving the mere addition of an un to the professors surname and attempts to draw a crude illustration of the professor until the pencil breaksthe professor is then shown leaving his house for class which is followed by the chiming of a large cuckootype clock the clock is shown along with birds ironically perched on it and its statue figure which passes by from one side of the clock to the other as it chimes the shenanigans are quickly broken up by a student barking watch out the old man the students quickly return to their seats and are just as quickly instructed to sit down the professor takes his seat and blows his nose with his handkerchief which leads to his noticing that his notebook has been defaced he searches the class for the culprit and homes in on the most nervous of the bunch angst the aptlynamed character played by rolf muller he instructs angst to erase the additions while angst attempts to plead his innocence the professor doesnt care and makes him erase it regardlessthe professor resumes his lesson for the day leading off with a passage from hamlet act iii scene 1 the famous to be or not to be soliloquy the professor chooses a student to recite some of hamlet only to interrupt him because of his poor pronunciation of english the professor attempts to get the student to say the instead of za by placing a pencil in his mouth he finally gets frustrated and has students write a paper on how the story of julius caesar would have differed if mark antony had not delivered his eulogy yet another reference to a tragic and illfated shakespearian character one student appears to be cheating but is actually looking what is revealed to be a lola postcard with a dress that can be blown to reveal her undergarments the professor realizes this and takes the card saying warning his students that there will be consequences as he places it in his own notebook the troublemakers are not happy about this while angst the teachers pet is pleased by the professors discovery implicating the other boys the troublemakers decide to take action against angstafter class is out the troublemakers hide outside the door and wait for angst to leave class when he does they trip him causing his books to fly open on the ground angsts books have cards with lola on them which upsets the professor angst and the professor go to his office to talk about the cards angst swears the cards do not belong to him but the professor doesnt care for angsts protestations regardless of whether he is innocent or not angst then tells the professor that the others dont like him because he doesnt go out at night to the blue angel with them to see girls the professors interest is piqued by these new factsthe blue angel is a cabaret featuring women singing more than dancing on a stage lola is finally seen on stage for the first time performing she sings as the professor is shown entering the bar meanwhile the students are backstage with lola trying to sweettalk her lola flirts but does little more with the students she then takes the stage again singing of her longing for a real man a heman which leads to her declaring she will find the one tonightthis is followed by the professors entrance the students see him enter and run to hide backstage the professor looks in the crowd for the students but is interrupted by lolas spotlight being pointed at his back he turns to see lola in person for the first time as she seems to be singing to himthis is interrupted when he sees one of his students and begins to chase him as he looks through the rooms backstage he stumbles upon a very sad clown  an oddly foreboding image there is a brief scene of a heavier woman doing a dance with only her eyes as a middleeastern type of music is playedmeanwhile lola comes backstage and asks what the man is doing in her room after some pleasantries are exchanged she begins to undress to change into her next costume the professor seems very thrown off by this leading him to block the doorway through which people are moving on and off stage he is then referred to as a roadblock which causes him to move back out of the way lola goes upstairs and drops her panties to the professor then comes down fully dressed for her next performanceat this point the loud magician is introduced yelling to the other women performers he is protective of lola until he learns of the prestige of dr immanuel rath suddenly the magician kiepert karl gerron attempts to relate and justify his job to the professor kiepert then demands that lola go on stage as he puts on a fake mustache the professor accuses the magician of inappropriately accommodating his students whereupon the professor immediately spots one of his students and chases them outthe next scene is probably the most out of place or random in the movie angst is sleeping in his bed when a noise wakes him shadows approach as some boys jump out and attack him by slapping him this is obviously retaliation for telling the professor about the blue angel the professor is then shown going home to sleep but cant seem to shake the memory of lola out of his head especially because her undergarments have ended up in his jacket mysteriouslythe next day the professor puts on his coat and goes to return lolas panties the professor arrives and the students are forced to hide in the cellar the garments are exchanged and lola sees that the professor is there to see her again she shows a playful grin as she begins to seduce him and the students watch from the cellarlola begins her game of cat and mouse babying the professor by combing his hair then asking him how beautiful he thinks she is before things get serious she blows some powder in his face and then treats him like a baby again things finally begin to progress with the magician demanding that lola drink with a visiting sailor with lots of cash the sailor treats lola rudely as the professor watches he becomes furious and chases out the sailor after a fight of sortsthe sailor then returns with the cops causing the magician to hide the professor in the cellar the professor finds his students and emerges from the cellar bringing them up with him the ordeal with the sailor is resolved by the police taking him back to the station because one of the parties to the scuffle is a sober professor who is much more credible to the officer than a drunk sailor the professor talks of punishing the students but only chases them outthe professor is then given drinks to calm his nerves leading to his becoming pleasantly inebriated as he is serenaded by lola lola sings of how she is falling in love again and cant help it the song is once again prophetic like the sad clown and the shakespearian references of things to comehe wakes up in lolas bed the next morning lola has a singing bird which comes as a delight to the professor she prepares breakfast for the two of them which leads to the final part of her plan to trap her new love interest the professor runs to school when he hears the school bells because he is so late for class a student is able to draw intricate drawings of the professors antics the previous night including one that depicts him as cupid in love with lola the professor tries to punish the students but cant keep them under control the head of the school realises that raths authority has been undermined and decides that the his actions have damaged his reputation to the point where he should either resign or be dismissedthe professor is left with no choice but to follow his heart and propose to lola he packs up his items from the classroom and goes to lola one shot of the professor in the empty classroom shows his despair as well as being another indication of things to come the group of travelling artistes lola is in are packing to leave for another town as the professor arrives he proposes to marry to keep her this leads first to her laughing but ultimately to the couple marryingwedding music is played as the two have a reception with all of the other members of the traveling show the magician then makes eggs appear from the professors nose to the delight of everyone the eggs cause lola to begin clucking like a chicken in turn causing the professor to crow like a roosterearly in the relationship the professor sees some postcards spilling from lolas suitcase which he objects to strongly he states that as long as he has a penny to his name they will not sell those postcards lola keeps them just in case which turns out to be not too much later as the next time the professor is shown he is selling the postcards at a show this is the first scene in which the professor is shown as being lower than the others in this group he has fallen from his former position and is now just the person that fails to sell postcards at show even lola begins to talk down to him at this time the professor seems to be at his breaking point and leaves during the humiliating talk aimed at him by the others in this group however he quickly returns to lolalola has the professor assist in getting her ready for the next show he takes her curler and burns a page of a calendar this signifies the passage of time which changes from days to the year 1925 to the year 1929 the professor is now playing with clown makeup and appears to be a shadow of his former self as he applies a clown nose and wig in front of a mirror it now seems that he has become the sad clown from earlier in the filmas the professor is preparing his costume the magician enters to tell him that the next town they will be visiting is the professors hometown and that they will be performing at the blue angel the magician seems to be in extra high spirits because the show is a sellout because of the top attraction the former

in love with lola and pursues her lola seems to be faithful to her husband despite mazeppas clear interest in herbefore his big performance the professor is prepped by the magician during this process the professor just stares coldly into space a shell of a person just sitting in a chair the magician constantly encourages the blankfaced immanuel to perform well meanwhile mazeppa and lola walk past the professor together poking fun at him which does not stir any emotion in him before he can do anything or find the source of the laughter upstairs he must go on stage lola even comes downstairs to force the scaredlooking professor onstagefinally the professor makes his big stage debut with the magician the confused clown or former professor is then humiliated by the magician who breaks eggs on the clowns head as he watches lola flirting with mazeppa backstage finally the professor appears to crack up mentally crowing wildly like a rooster at the magicians command he continues to crow as he chases lola trying to kill her his attack is eventually stopped by a group of men led by mazeppa they wrap the professor up in a straitjacketonce the professor has finally calmed down the magician tries to reason with him the magician promises to take care of the situation for the professor after undoing the straitjacket once the professor is alone he takes a coat and hat and sneaks out as he

the bell until someone opens the door the professor stumbles past this person and into his former classroom he collapses grasping onto his desk mirroring the scene in which he left the school for the first time the man at the door finds the professor at the desk and attempts to remove him from it but is unsuccessful he leaves the professor grasping the desk as a lone spot light shines on him and
