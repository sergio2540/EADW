next day after school after she presents herself to him and he takes her to an abandoned field he starts an earnest conversation and only kisses her even though she is obviously willing brandon is clearly not the bad seed that he puts himself out to be but just like dawn he is a socially awkward kid who hides his own unhappiness behind anger and aggressionmeanwhile marks band is joined by steve

abusive and alcoholic widowed father and a mentally retarded older brother who requires constant supervision after angrily rejecting ralphy as a boyfriend dawn is left with no friends at allthe next occasion of dawns embarrassment is a lawn party to celebrate her parents 18th wedding anniversary when dawn refuses to tear down her clubhouse to make room for the party her mother has mark and missy destroy it and gives them her share of a chocolate cake at the party missy humiliates dawn when she pushes her into a kiddie pool for no reason in front of the assembled guests who laugh at it that evening the family watches a videotape of the party with all of them except dawn laughing when dawn falls into the water which further alienates her as her immature parents continue to remain oblivious to dawns alienation later that night dawn smashes the videotape to pieces with a hammer and briefly brandishes her hammer over missys bed as she sleeps to bludgeon her to death but dawn cannot bring herself to commit murder and instead walks away and goes to beddawns ultimate personal disaster occurs a few weeks later when her fathers car breaks down while he is driving home from work and her mother has to pick him up dawn is to tell missy to find a ride home from ballet class while their mother is away however missy argues with dawn who retaliates by not telling her with the result that missy is kidnapped by a stranger while she is walking home alone when missys tutu is found in times square dawn goes to new york city hoping to find missy and become a hero to make her difficult parents notice and respect her after a full day and night of searching fruitlessly for missy dawn phones home to check up on what is going on and mark tells her that missy has been found by the police after she was abducted by a pedophile neighbor dawn returns home dejected and sees that her mother was too preoccupied with missys traumatic kidnapping ordeal to even notice dawns absence but at least to dawns credit her parents never figure out that she was indirectly responsible for missy kidnapping by withholding information from her that led to missy being abducted in the first placeafter this dawns classmates make fun of her as she gives a speech in the assembly hall to thank them for their emotional support it is only after the principal orders the unruly students to be quiet dawn gives herself enough mental strength to finish her speecha few more weeks later school is let out for the summer dawn is relieved that her painful ordeal at school is over at least for the next three months afterwards dawns mental state takes a further blow when mark offers her no hope of a better life until high school which according to him is will not be much betteras the movie comes to an end dawn finds herself literally back where she started only worse she is still unpopular and unattractive her parents have gone from mistreating and neglecting her to ignoring her completely in favor for missys abduction rather then counting down the long summer days to go back to school for 8th grade and thus endure another hellish year of bullying and abuse dawn decides to get away from her home life by signing herself up for a monthlong school summer trip to floridas walt disney world her selfinvolved parents are still too preoccupied with their own lives to approve of dawns permission to leave for the summer and do not even notice her packing up to leave much less say goodbye to herthe final scene shows dawn sitting anonymously among her other classmates on the school bus as she obediently joins other students singing the school anthem during the field trip to florida as she sorrowfully looks out the bus window to ponder her uncertain future 7.5school ballerina
