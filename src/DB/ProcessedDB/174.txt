not precise the pedestal sinks and the chamber begins to disintegrate jones runs narrowly avoiding the darts when he arrives at a bottomless pit he  sapito had crossed earlier using jones bullwhip sapito crosses safely but refuses to give jones his whip unless he gives him the idol sapito drops the whip and runs off jones manages to jump across and pull himself up and escape under the stone

sorenson flying a seaplane though indy isnt pleased to find jocks pet snake reggie insideback stateside indy teaches an archeology class and is still upset over the loss of the statue which he surmises belloq is taking to marrakesh he has found pieces he feels will pay for a trip to marrakesh to find belloq but indys friend marcus brody denholm elliott dashes that hope by informing him that two army intelligence officers want to talk to him about abner ravenwood his former teacher who was his friend until indy broke up with his daughter marion karen allenthe army officers are concerned because theyve intercepted a german cable concerning a mammoth archaeological dig in the egyptian desert when they read the cable indy and marcus realize the nazis have discovered tanis an ancient city buried in a gigantic sandstorm in 980 bc and the possible burial site of the ark of the covenant the ark was built by ancient hebrews to hold the stone tablets on which moses inscribed the ten commandments it holds immense mystical power  enough to allow the nazis to level mountains and lay waste to entire regionsindy flies to nepal followed by a nazi agent toht ronald lacey to confront marion ravenwood who runs a restaurant and bar and who can outdrink anyone because he needs the headpiece to the staff of ra whose crystals will allow him to determine the exact location of the ark marion still bitter over their breakup nonetheless accepts when indy offers her 3000 and the promise of more when they return stateside she is cryptic about the headpiece and after indy leaves she ponders it as she wears it around her necktoht and several sherpa heavies enter the bar and hold marion hostage with toht ready to torture her for the headpiece indy returns and a firefight erupts during which the fireplace is dislodged and the building begins burning down toht finds the headpiece but when he grabs it hes badly burned  leaving an image of one side of the headpiece branded on his hand he escapes while indy and marion do likewise and fly to egypt to see indys pal sallah john rhysdavies who is working on the nazi site and who reveals that the nazis are aided by a french archaeologist belloqlater while shopping at a cairo bazaar indy and marion are attacked by swordwielding arabs working for nazi agents indy fights them off but in the confusion marion is trapped in a large basket and taken by two of the terrorists the effort to track her down is held up by a man brandishing a sword in intimidating fashion the swordsman is shot down in short order by a thoroughly unimpressed indysoon indy spots a basket carried to a truck filled with explosives and is fired on by a submachinegunwielding assailant his nazi commander orders the arabs to take off but indy shoots them and the truck crashes exploding and destroying the basketdisconsolate over losing marion indy drowns his sorrows in drink but is met by more nazi agents who escort him to a table at which is seated belloq who gleefully talks about finding the ark indy no longer caring whether he lives or dies reaches for his sidearm as arabs inside pull rifles  only to see sallahs large brood of children rush in and the arabs to turn out to be us marines much to the embarassment of belloqsallah takes indy to see a shaman who is reading the ra headpiece after both men have learned that belloq and his wehrmacht aide colonel dietrich wolf kahler have obtained a copy of the headpiece neither man is aware that it is a duplicate traced from tohts burned hand the shaman reveals two critical facts first that the headpiece gives the precise height of the staff of ra and second that the staff the nazis used was too long  so their excavation is over a mile away from the arks actual burial site which is known as the well of soulsinfiltrating the mammoth site indy is lowered into an underground maproom containing a precisely detailed miniature of the city using the ra headpiece he identifies the precise location of the well of souls sneaking further around the gigantic camp indy is shocked to find marion alive but bound and gagged indy starts to free her but when she reveals that the nazis keep asking about him and what he knows he realizes he cant cut her loose without revealing his presence to the nazislate that afternoon indy and sallah sneak a digging party of their own to the actual location of the well of souls late into the night they dig open the chamber and to indys horror it is filled with dangerous snakes indy clears an area of snakes with burning torches then lowers himself into the chamber and burns many of the snakes alive with flaming gasoline sallah follows and the two eventually find the gigantic chest that is the arkby now it is dawn and only now does belloq notice the commotion a mile away the nazis surround the site and indy is left trapped inside but dietrich leaves him with something else  marion who is thrown into the chamber and the area closed offindy notices a wall where snakes are entering he climbs a mammoth statue and with all his might breaks it from its foundation and it crashes through the wall the two find an opening to the surface and discover the airfield at the excavation camp where there is a bizarre nazi transport plane the two sneak up to the plane but indy is attacked by a mechanic and a prolonged fight ensues that is joined by a burly nazi who pummels indy before being punched backward and shredded to bits by the planes propellers marion seizes one of the planes machine guns and opens fire on nazi soldiers in the process setting a fuel dump aflame the fire destroys the area and the plane explodes but indy and marion escapedietrich orders his men to transport the ark by truck to cairo when sallah finds indy and marion he is overjoyed theyre alive and tells them of dietrichs plan indy takes a horse and pursues the convoy seizing the truck containing the ark and surviving a brutal chase and fight with nazi soldiers to drive the ark to safetyhe and marion board a ship taking the ark back to the us but a nazi submarine captures the ship the ark is taken aboard the sub and marion taken prisoner for belloq indy however escapes nazi pursuit and rides the submarine as it sails on the ocean surface to an island where belloq and the nazis trek to the top of a mountainindy has grabbed a rocket launcher and intercepts belloq vowing to blow up the ark unless marion is freed but belloq calls indys bluff knowing indy wants to know what the ark contains as much as anyone indy finds he cant carry out his threat and is seizedat an elaborate ceremony atop the mountain indy and marion tied to a pole can only watch as the ark is opened but it contains nothing but sand the remains of the stone tablets no sooner is it opened however than its spirits suddenly appear indy and marion remembering an ancient code that requires people to close their eyes and not look at the nowfreed spirits withstand the mayhem that ensues as the energy of the ark surges forth and its spirits attack the nowterrified nazis killing the entire contingent and destroying belloq in gruesome fashion the energy mass surges high into the sky before returning to the ark and resealing it leaving indy and marion drained but freedweeks later indy and marcus feud with the army officers over the whereabouts of the ark indy angry that the army has no idea what it has in the ark  though it appears they in fact do understand what they have as the ark is sealed in a large crate and stored anonymously in a gigantic
