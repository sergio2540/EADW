beckett believes that someone deliberately hid his paperwork to give the firm a pretext to fire him and that the firing is actually as a result of his diagnosis with aids he asks several attorneys to take his case including personal injury lawyer joe miller denzel washington with whom he had been involved in a previous case miller who is admittedly homophobic and knows little about becketts aids initially declines to take the case and immediately visits his doctor to find out if he could have contracted the aids through shaking becketts hand the doctor explains the methods of hiv infection the doctor then offers to take a sample of millers blood suspecting that miller was asking about aids because he suspected he had contracted it and was trying to hide it miller dismisses the request by laughing it off thinking it a joke unable to find a lawyer willing to represent him beckett is compelled to act as his own attorney while researching a case at a law library miller sees beckett at a nearby table after a librarian announces that he has found a book on aids discrimination for beckett others in the library begin to first stare and then move away and the librarian suggests beckett retire to a private room disgusted by their behavior miller approaches beckett and reviews the material he has gathered it is obvious he has decided to take the case upon receiving a summons by miller the head of the firm charles wheeler jason robards worries about the damage the lawsuit could do to his business and reputation although one partner ron vawter unsuccessfully tries to convince them to settle out of court with beckett
as the case goes before the court wheeler takes the stand claiming that beckett was incompetent and claiming that he had deliberately tried to hide his condition the defense repeatedly suggests that beckett had invited his illness through promiscuity and was therefore not a victim in the course of testimony it is revealed that the partner who had noticed becketts lesion had previously worked with a woman who had contracted aids after a blood transfusion and so would have recognized the lesion as relating to aids to prove that the lesions would have been visible miller asks beckett to unbutton his shirt while on the witness stand revealing that his lesions were indeed visible and recognizable as such
during crossexamination beckett admits that he was originally planning to tell his law colleagues that he was gay but changed his mind after hearing them make homophobic jokes in the sauna of a health club when asked about the truth of how he got infected he confirms that he engaged in anonymous sex with another man at a pornographic movie theater however he and miller gain an advantage when the partner who advised settling out of court confesses he long suspected beckett had aids but never said anything and how he regrets his inaction
beckett collapses during wheelers testimony during his hospitalization the jury votes in his favor awarding him back pay damages for pain and suffering and punitive damages totaling nearly 45m miller visits beckett in the hospital after the verdict and overcomes his fear enough to touch becketts face after becketts family leaves the room he tells miguel that he is ready to die a short scene immediately afterward shows miller getting the word that beckett has died the movie ends with a reception at becketts home following the funeral where many mourners including the millers view home movies of beckett as a healthy child 7.7aids lawyer gay homophobia gay-love illness dying death-of-lover male-nurse bigotry man-dancing-with-man courtroom-drama medical male-male-kiss mother-son-relationship trial blockbuster philadelphia-pennsylvania dancing party partner dancer inspiring-story gay-kiss library tragic-hero death-of-hero gay-hero ends-with-funeral pennsylvania hypocrite unfair-dismissal hospital human-immunodeficiency-virus gay-lead-character city-name-in-title place-name-in-title main-character-dies gay-interest kiss home-movie disease gay-rights terminal-illness tragic-ending cult-film wrongful-termination homosexual one-word-title death-of-boyfriend prejudice thinness hypocrisy tough-guy gay-slur costume-party sexuality
