allelon ruggiero richard stanley thang an unknown and lethal virus has wiped out five billion people in 1996 only 1 of the population has survived by the year 2035 and is forced to live underground a convict james cole reluctantly volunteers to be sent back in time to 1996 to gather information about the origin of the epidemic who hes told was spread by a mysterious army of the twelve monkeys and locate the virus before it mutates so that scientists can study it unfortunately cole is mistakenly sent to 1990 six years earlier than expected and is arrested and locked up in a mental institution where he meets dr kathryn railly a psychiatrist and jeffrey goines the insane son of a famous scientist and virus expert when cole a convict volunteer is sent back in time to find information on a deadly virus that will destroy 5000000000 members of the human race in 19961997 he mistakenly arrives in 1990 after explaining his plea to dr kathryn railly he is placed in a mental institution in 1996 he kidnaps railly using her to find the 12 monkeys a group of revolutionists that are planning to release the virus into select cities but he is wanted by the authorities for murder and kidnapping plus he refuses to return to the future he is in love with railly terry gilliams nightmarish lowtechhightech future vision takes place in 1997 after a deadly virus has killed 99 of the human populationforcing the survivors to flee beneath our planets surface this leaves the other animals topside to rule the earth once again the scientists select james cole an imprisoned sociopath to return to the past and gather information useful in the defense against this contagion once back in time he is to investigate the mysterious army of the twelve monkeys and report his findings scientific social and political themes like time travel and its inherent paradoxes and nested loops mental illness the nature of reality animal rights and the armageddonpotential of unchecked technological advances are artfully and cleverly explored the time is the indeterminate future a virus deliberately released in 1996 in multiple locations around the world has killed off five billion people survivors have established an elaborate underground civilization because the earths surface is considered uninhabitable by humans from time to time prisoners volunteer to don protective gear and gather specimens of insects from the surface to test for the presence of the virusone such prisoner is james cole who after retrieving samples is given the chance to go back in time to 1996 and find information about the group believed responsible known as the army of 12 monkeys throughout the ensuing episodes cole finds himself remembering as if in dreams various things that he witnessed as a child including the killing of a man in an airport this persists as a theme throughout the filmmiscalculation sends cole to 1990 and he finds himself incarcerated in an insane asylum his psychiatrist kathryn railly thinks she has met him before but his ravings are incoherent to her and eventually he is locked up with other lunatics there he meets jeffrey goines who is definitely off the wall but who tries to help him escape eventually cole is snatched back to his present time interrogated and given a second chance to complete his mission a second miscalculation sends him to the battlefields of world war i where he is wounded in the leghowever much the result of miscalculation these visits are they prove instrumental when the scientists of coles present finally succeed in sending him to 1996 cole kidnaps dr railly and tries to convince her that he is from the future he finds that jeffrey goines whose father is a famous virologist is now out of the asylum working for his father and has formed the army of 12 monkeys cole is now racing against time and after a few mishaps finally decides that he wants to stay in 1996 with dr railly surrendering to the inevitable destruction of human lifeby this time dr railly has become convinced that somehow cole knows somethinghis predictions of the outcome of minor events is too uncanny the discovery of a world war i bullet in coles leg forces her to check a photograph taken on the battlefield which impossibly shows cole in the trenches she becomes convinced that the army of 12 monkeys indeed poses a threat and she persuades cole to take up his cause againan essential element in the communication between coles past and present is a telephone number where he can leave a message for the scientists of his own present when goines and his army release all the animals in the zoo to roam the streets of new york and then posts flyers declaring we did it cole realizes that the army is not the threat and he leaves a phone message to that effect shortly after jose a fellow volunteer from the present approaches cole with orders for him to complete his mission and hands him a revolver cole initially refuses but then notices a guard from the present glaring at him jose makes it clear dr railly will be killed if cole does not complymeanwhile the police are after cole for kidnapping dr railly in an airport while attempting with cole to elude capture dr railly recognizes dr peters a man who worked with jeffrey goiness father in the virology lab and an apocalypse nut she rushes to inform cole of this and frantically identifies him along with his travel plans with jose overhearing this the man goes through airport screening and manages to persuade security that his biological samplesone for each of the many cities on his itineraryare harmless dr railly alerts cole and they attempt to stop the man to dr raillys horror cole is shot by the police while chasing the real perpetrator who escapes to board his plane coles death is witnessed by a boy named james who is with his parents the young coleon the plane the escaped perp takes his seat and gets into conversation with his fellow passenger we recognize her as the woman lead scientist from coles present cole had stated once the virus was located a scientist would be sent back to study it in its original unmutated form so that a cure could be developed in the present she identifies herself as jones and cryptically says shes in insurance 8.1virus future monkey 1990s volunteer animal mental-institution underground epidemic past murder
