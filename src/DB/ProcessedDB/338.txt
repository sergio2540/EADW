beans unorthodox arrival at the gallery worries many of davids colleagues particularly his boss george grierson harris yulin who subtly warns david that he will be responsible for beans actions at the unveiling of the painting but david promises that he can handle bean convinced that he is merely a little eccentric when david takes bean back to his house alison departs for her mothers home unwilling to live with bean with his family gone david decides to take bean on a tour of the los angeles art galleries however bean decides that he and david should go to pacific park instead but lands in police detainment for the second time after accidentally tampering with the controls of a motion simulator ride making it go dangerously fast after deeming that his first ride earlier was too slow this prompts lieutenant brutus richard gant who dealt with bean at the airport to make david accountable for bean threatening to arrest bean if he ever steps out of line again
following a miserable dinner with grierson which david had forgotten about where bean accidentally blows up the microwave after attempting to cook their thanksgiving turkey in it david finally realises that bean is not a doctor and knows nothing about art he is obliged to continue with the deception however as he has already staked his professional career on beans supposed reputation as a noted art scholar the next day whistlers mother arrives at the grierson art gallery and bean is given a few minutes alone to study it in an effort to keep him out of trouble while dusting the frame bean accidentally sneezes on the painting and wipes it with a handkerchief not knowing that it is covered in blue ink from a broken pen and therefore the painting is stained terrified bean takes it to the caretakers cupboard to get some agent by which to remove the ink he uses lacquer thinner which also dissolves the painted face from the painting much to his horror bean attempts to patch it up with an extremely unconvincing cartoon face upon seeing it david is also horrified and hides the painting behind its metal security shutters fearing that david will lose his job and possibly face criminal proceedings for his vandalism he and bean head off to a bar to drown their sorrows
during the night bean hatches his plan to restore whistlers mother he gathers a few items from davids house and makes his way to the grierson art gallery he distracts the only security guard on duty by putting laxative in his coffee followed by switching the mens bathroom keys with some other set he removes the destroyed painting from its frame and replaces it with a poster version of itself glossing it with an egg and varnish mix to make it appear authentic at the unveiling of whistlers mother the next day david is overjoyed to see the painting is restored but expects bean who has totally forgotten to come up with a speech to make a fool of himself on national television when he takes the podium at the press conference however beans brief but effective offthecuff speech regarding the work is both very simple and very deep cementing the publics perception of him as a scholarly virtuoso despite initial doubts the officials and hierarchy appear to take his words to heart and enjoy the speech after the unveiling brutus finds david and informs him that jennifer has been involved in a motorcycle accident because she rebelled against david for not getting rid of bean and is in intensive care bean and david are given a police escort to the hospital to see jennifer but brutus stops on his way to deal with an armed robber who shoots brutus in his stomach before being arrested
due to a mixup at the hospital bean is mistaken for a medical doctor and pushed into an operating theatre containing brutus who is shot in the stomach and barely alive while the other doctors and nurses are distracted bean unconventionally retrieves the bullet and eventually rescues brutus earning the admiration of his colleagues bean is again mistaken for a doctor and this time david takes him to see jennifer who is unconscious bean unsure what to do attempt to use a defibrillator to bring jennifer back to life but accidentally shocks himself and is sent flying across the room and lands on jennifer in her bed and waking her up in the process still not recognising bean david and alison tell him that they will offer him anything bean reveals himself and then asks if he can stay with them for another week before returning to london though baffled the langleys gladly accept after another week in los angeles with the langleys for which he gives the family gifts and explores the city a bald man shows him his middle finger bean thinks it is a sign of good luck so he shows this to everybody in his flat bean getting ready to bed for the night turns off the light and looks at the original vandalised whistlers mother which now has prideofplace on his wall and shows it to his teddy before closing his eyes and going to sleep 6.2eccentric whistler's mother london england los angeles california miracle playing with food security guard switching keys catching food in one's mouth sneaking out cult film shower hospital candy two way mirror motorcycle accident family relationships finger gun improvisation x lax sneeze british comedy vomit broken promise gun in airport paper bag motorcycle stuffing turkey famous painting sketch microwave husband wife relationship turkey the beatles song mistake visual humor cultural difference spiking drink skateboard despair art gallery airport key appetizer convertible stupidity houseguest unwanted guest cooking dinner briton abroad explosion mistaken identity mistaken for doctor photo booth deep sleep catching food in mouth based on tv series imitation bathroom blockbuster flashlight riding motorcycle road trip based on sketch comedy coma red carpet marriage problems skateboarding singing drunk boy reference to meat loaf light bulb surprise after end credits portrait reference to jon bon jovi roller coaster disguise friendship speech teddy bear reference to row row row your boat amusement park thick accent wearing underwear on head airplane poster father daughter relationship eccentricity reference to cindy crawford singing reference to brad pitt independent film character name in title
