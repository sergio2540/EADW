she goes down to see what happened to sam the creature corners her and viciously bites off her faceaunt millie is awakened by screaming but she attributes it to the horror movie that charles is watching on tv in his room charles is obsessed with magic monsters and scaring people when aunt millie returns to call charles to breakfast he surprises her by wearing a scary mask and costume and setting off flash powder when she opens the door pete disapproves of charles hobby being more interested in schoolwork and science pete fancies himself a scientist and he sets up a study date with

realuncle herb falls asleep in the living room and aunt millie heads over to her mothers house to help set up the luncheon an electrician arrives to investigate a problem with the circuit breaker box in the basement of the house and charles sees an opportunity to scare somebody slipping on his mask he creeps down into the basement which is flooded with several inches of water but he discovers something strange the basement is swarming with small tadpolelike creatures the size of small fish charles follows them silently until he finds the electricians body in a corner with hundreds of the smaller creatures feasting on it the creatures are all of varying sizes from the small fishsized tadpoles to armsized worms and there is a huge one presumably the original that has developed three different heads the smaller ones seem to be spawn given off by the adult monster each with the potential to grow into a full sized threat the creatures have no eyes and charles discovers they are sensitive to sound in which their open mouths filled with hundreds of sharp teeth seem to be their receiver of sounds since they apparently do not have ears either the large threeheaded creature almost eats him when he snaps his fingers and he is only able to distract it by tossing his flashlight into a far corner and allowing it to go after the noise adding to the horror he sees barbs disembodied head lying on the cement floor partially consumed by spawn and realizes that the creatures have killed his parents charles stands motionless against a basement wall unable to move in fear of being discovered by the alien creaturesmeanwhile ellen and frankie arrive for the study session in a flurry of excitement they have discovered one of the creatures dead on the way over to the house and theyve brought along its body to dissect in an attempt to understand what it is frankie hypothesizes that the creature could be from outer space but pete is hostile to that idea and dismisses it as ignorance ellen reminds pete that to make suppositions scientists must have some imaginationat bunnys house millie arrives and helps her set up for her guests bunny is unaware that the spawn have reached the house and are lurking in her kitchen one of them gets into her food processor tainting the vegetable sauce she is making when her guests arrive all of them older ladies they are horrified when they taste the sauce with the dead spawn in it and the armsized creatures suddenly come at them from all angles biting at fingers and toes latching onto their legs and arms like small leeches the women fight back and smash and kill a number of the creatures all of them bearly escaping with their lives in millies carback at the house pete ellen and frankie seek out uncle herb to get his opinion on the strange creature theyve found they find herbs body in the living room with hundreds of spawn eating him from the inside out the threeheaded adult creature confronts them in the hallway and they run upstairs to charless bedroom charles who understands that the creature will chase after them because of the noise they are making distracts it with a radio which it eats before the creature can find charles and kill him the doorbell ringskathy has finally arrived at the house pete and the others try to warn her from an upstairs window but she doesnt hear them and goes into the house anyway the monster nearly grabs her in the hallway outside charles bedroom but she escapes its huge mouthdesperate to summon help the teens devise a plan they will make a dash for petes bedroom where there is a telephone and theyll call for help but the monster ambushes them in the hallway pete runs to another room frankie and kathy run upstairs to the attic while ellen stays in charles bedroom and slams the door the creature attracted by her shouting knocks the door down and rushes at her before ellen can escape out the window the monster bites her head off and her headless body falls out into the front yard of the housepete climbs out onto the roof and sees ellens body on the ground below he also notices his parents car still in the garage meaning they never left kathy and frankie see ellen from the attic window too and pete eventually climbs in through the small opening he is in shock and is delirious telling them ellens really scared when he tries to open the barricaded door frankie tries to stop him but pete becomes unhinged fighting with frankie and screaming for ellen frankie knocks him unconscious but its too late his shouting attracts the creature fortunately charles has concocted a plan rushing to his bedroom he assembles a hollow head full of flash powder embedding a frayed electrical cord in the explosive materialas the creature advances on frankie and kathy kathy is hysterical and screaming charles rushes up the stairs and tells them to be quiet then he baits the creature with the fake head at first it refuses to eat it until charles gets the idea to scream the monster immediately devours the head with the dangling power cord hanging just outside its mouth using extension cords charles lures the creature closer and closer until he is close enough to an electrical outlet to plug it in however one of the armsized spawn creatures lands on his right shoulder from the above rafter and begins bitting into him charles is forced to use a screwdriver to stab at the spawn attached to his shoulder until the threeheaded mother spawn approaches and inadverantly eats the wounded spawn creature from charles shoulder thus freeing him charles manages to get at the extension cord and plugs it into an outlet and the threeheaded spawn creature instantly explodes in a gory shower of alien blood and body parts alll over the attic interiorthe threat no longer a secret a massive hunt for the spawn has been mobilized at the house and the surrounding areas as dozens of townspeople converge on the area aunt millie arrives back at the house and cares for the wounded and shaken pete and charles as best she can while policemen and volunteers scour the surrounding woods and bushes for spawn which they stun with cattle prods or stab with shovels picks and axes the creatures are dumped onto various bonfires that the locals set and are disposed of including the remains of the threeheaded eightfoot mother spawn frankie and kathy are also shaken but alive and are taken away in an ambulancein the final scene several hours later night falls the house now deserted except for a posted patrolman seems to have been cleared of all the aliensthat is until the patrolman hears a rumbling in the ground it seems as if an earthquake is hitting until the entire hillside next to the house erupts with the head of a gigantic spawn even larger than the house itself
