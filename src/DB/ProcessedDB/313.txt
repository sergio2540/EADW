making pottery as her granddaughter lizzie suzy amis casually goes about the house feeding the dogs the tv is heard in the background it is on the news station and what catches roses attention at first is a line said by someone mentioning the titanic it shows brock lovett as he discusses what he is doing rose gets up and listens in brock speaks of the care his experts on the ship are taking with what they found in the wreck they show the picture of the woman and rose stares in amazement nearly speechless back on the ship lovett is helping to launch the submarine into the water once again when he is interrupted by his comrade bobby buell nicholas cascone bobby claims that there is a call waiting for him that he will want to take brock reluctantly gets on the phone and speaks to the elderly rose the first thing rose has to say is i was just wondering if you had found the heart of the ocean yet mr lovett and he is hooked instantly he asks whether or not rose knows who the woman in the picture is and rose certainly does she tells him it is herthe next thing seen is rose and lizzie being shipped by a helicopter over to lovetts boat onboard brock is being briefed by lewis on roses background he believes rose is nothing but a fake seeking publicity he describes how the woman rose claims to be rose dewitt bukater died on the titanic when she was 17 according to records he has done a background check on the old woman all the way back to the 1920s when she had worked as an actress in new york back then her name had been rose dawson not dewitt bukater she later married a man named michael calvert and they moved to cedar rapids iowa where they had kids but there is no history or record of her before 1920 still brock believes rose may be who she says rose and lizzie are then seen exiting the helicopter with their luggage rose and lizzie get set up in their quarters arranging roses pictures beside the bed brock asks rose if she needs anything and her only desire is to see her drawing rose goes into the room where everything recovered from the wreck is and sees the portrait in a tank of clear water and closes her eyes remembering the day it was sketched we see the hands of a youthful man sketching the drawing for the first time we then see his blue eyes look up wisps of blonde hair in his vision rose opens her eyes and comes back to realitylovett goes on explaining the origin of the diamond to rose describing its color and the famous rulers who wore it rose says it was dreadful and heavy brock has tracked down the insurance records he said a man named

simulation of the titanics sinking describing it as something you would want to be on very badly rose remembers the experience as more horrific and lovett asks if shell share the experience with themrose stands and sees pictures of two double doors from the wreck its ornate wroughtiron window design still intact she suddenly remembers a time when two men stood there happy to greet her inside she begins crying a bit and thinking she is traumatized by these images lizzie suggests that she rest for a while rose refuses and says its been eightyfour long yearsbut remembers the new ship so well she begins telling her story and the narrative shiftson april 10 1912 we see the titanic docked at southampton england roughly ten minutes before its maiden voyage the world is lively and amazed at the sight of the huge ship a carriage man opens a door of one car and helps out a woman seventeen year old rose dewitt bukater kate winslet rose remarks on how she doesnt think its size is much bigger than the mauratania and is not as impressed by it as much as her fiancé caledon hockley billy zane cal tells rose that the titanic is far too amazing to insult and tells roses mother ruth dewitt bukater frances fisher that rose is much too hard to impress cal then goes on to explain how god himself could not sink the ship when ruth states how the ship has been proclaimed unsinkable which we already know it will turn out to be anything but cal then puts his manservant spicer lovejoy david warner in charge of his possessions as he ruth and rose onboard the titanic the older rose is heard saying it was the ship of dreams to everyone else but she desperately didnt want to board and go back to america she was a well brought up girl on the outside but was screaming insideinside a nearby bar at the docks a group of four young men are playing poker two of them argue for a moment in different languages opposite them are an italian with a strong accent fabrizio de rozzi danny nucci and his american friend jack dawson leonardo dicaprio the two of them are apparently dirt poor one of the opposite men named olaf bjorn olsen yells at his companion sven dan pettersson for betting their third class tickets for the titanic jack states how somebodys lifes about to change as they each reveal their cards jack has a full house winning he and fabrizio dance around with the tickets then jack piles the money and the tickets into a bag olaf grabs jack by the collar and is about to punch him but instead hits sven for betting the tickets jack begins laughing merrily they are exhilarated by the fact that they are going to america but then the bartender tells them that they arent going to americathe ship will leave without them in five minutes jack and fabrizio then rush to the ship they join the other titanic passengers who are waving goodbye from the stern even though they know noone there the ships propellers start up as the ship sails off guided by the tugboats rose is in her stateroom marveling at some paintings she purchased as she prepares to put them on the wall cal does not like them their maid trudy bolt amy gaipa asks who the artist is and rose responds something picasso cal thinks the paintings are worthlesslater that evening when the ship stops in cherbourg france margaret molly brown kathy bates boards her wealth comes from her husband finding gold and ruth calls her new money after stopping in ireland the next day the ship plows west surrounded by the open ocean captain smith bernard hill tells first officer william murdoch ewan stewart to take her to sea the stokers in the engine room covered in soot and sweat shovel the coal into the massive boilers jack and fabrizio go to the very bow of the ship and look down at the water as the ship plows ahead the two spot dolphins jumping out of the water merrily as the ships workers work away down below to keep the ship going smith is happy the crew is happy and everything is going normally jack stands up on the bars of the bow at shouts the famous line im the king of the world he howls to the wind and puts his head back closes his eyes and spreads his arms out for balance the ship is then viewed on a grand scale from the bow to the hull to the stern it is seen its incredibly huge size obvious it seems incredible that man could have given birth to such a creationrose is next seen sitting at lunch with her mother cal and molly along with thomas andrews victor garber the architect of the ship and bruce ismay jonathan hyde one of the men who created of the titanic ismay and andrews discuss the ships design and how resistant she is to sinking rose looks bored and frustrated molly asks who thought of the name titanic ismay says that he did and he elaborates on how he wanted the name to convey size explaining the choice of the name for the olympic the titanics smaller sister ship rose patronizingly asks ismay if he knows of dr freud because his ideas on the male preoccupation with size might be of a particular interest to him most of them chuckle but ruth ridicules herback on the aft stern deck jack is sitting down next to fabrizio jack looks at a rather old man with a very young girl about six years old jack sketches them in a thin long brown sketch pad he has exceptional artistic skills next to him fabrizio and a young irish man are talking about who built the ship the irishman introduces himself to jack and fabrizio as tommy ryan jason barry jacks attention is suddenly directed toward rose who has stepped out of the first class cafe and is looking out at the water tommy tells him to forget her jack just continues to stare suddenly rose glances down at jack but then away then she does it again but leaves after cal steps outside to retrieve her that night rose is at dinner with the entire first class passengers everyone is chatty and lively but rose looks very sad and dazed ignoring everyone rose looks down in a trancelike state as everyone else ignores her sadnessafter dinner rose feeling trapped runs very fast along the promenade deck of the ship she runs as fast as she can to the stern of the ship not even noticing the only person there jack who is lying on a bench smoking and looking up at the stars at the back railing she pauses and looks over at the stern where the ships name appears rose climbs over the railing and perched on the outside of the railing appears ready to jump as she looks down jack approaches her he tells her not to jump but rose tells him to stay back and shell let go if he comes closer jack says he cant leave because he is now involved and if she jumps he has to go in after her and he begins taking off his jacket rose tells him thats ridiculous and that the fall alone would kill him jack says he knows it would hurt but he is much more concerned about the temperature of the water as he removes his shoes rose reluctantly asks how cold it is and he said probably just over freezing he asks if shes ever been to wisconsin and rose is genuinely surprised at the casual conversation jack goes on to say that he grew up there and once fell through some thin ice the water was so cold he couldnt breathe or think about anything but the pain rose is a little haunted by the story and jack says thats exactly why isnt looking forward to jumping in there after her he tells her he hopes she will climb back over so that hell be let off the hook he tells her to give him her hand again and she does she turns and faces him and jack breathes a sigh of relief they introduce themselves to each otherjack begins to help her over as she begins to climb over she slips and falls only jacks firm grip on her wrist keeps her from falling into the ocean she screams as jack struggles to pull her up she continues to cry for help and a couple of crewmen hear her and come running she pulls herself up and at last she is back up on the railing and jack has his arms around her tightly coaxing her that he has her and he falls back on top of her as he returns her safely to the ship the crewmen arrive suddenly and seeing rose in shock with her dress torn halfway to her thigh and jack on top of her gives them the impression that he has tried to make an advance or worsejack is arrested cal walks over to him and begins yelling at him but rose then tells cal it was an accident she makes up a story that she was leaning over to see the propellers and slipped the masteratarms asks jack if that is true and he says yes after rose gives him a pleading look one of the men who was with them calls jack a hero and then cal asks jack to join them for dinner tomorrow night to which jack agreesas cal rose and the other men start to leave jack asks lovejoy for some cigarettes they are alone when lovejoy marks how interesting it is that rose slipped so suddenly but he still had a chance to take his jacket and shoes off rose is alone in her cabin when cal walks in he tells rose he has noticed her melancholy behavior he comes in and has a present for her and opens a small case with a huge heartshaped bluediamond on a chain rose is amazed and cal has her try it on he tells her it was worn by louis xvi and that they called it the heart of the ocean cal tells rose that she is royalty and there is nothing he would deny her if she would not deny him and asks her to open her heart to him rose stares in her mirror touching the diamond with a haunted look on her facein the next scene jack and rose are seen walking together on the boat deck jack is talking about how he grew up he then asks rose what the real reason is that she came to see him she has come to thank jack for saving her jack asks why she wanted to kill herself rose says it was everything the people and how helpless she was she shows jack her huge engagement ring rose talks about how all of philadelphias society will be at her wedding but she feels like shes so lost and nobody even notices it jack asks rose if she loves cal rose thinks that is a very rude question and refuses to answer even though jack is persistent about eventually rose becomes completely bewildered that jack is asking this and prepares to storm off she shakes jacks hand and insults him more saying he deserved it they still are shaking hands and at last rose starts to leave then rose comes back and says that they are at her part of the ship and jack should leave jack laughs and says she is now the one being rude rose completely stumped on what to say next sees jack holding his sketchpad and seizes it as a way to spite himjack doesnt mind her taking it and watches her open it she slowly but still angrily remarks on how good they are and then they sit down on two deck chairs jack tells rose he used to live in paris and she is surprised she comes across some very graphic drawings of prostitutes in various poses jack shows a picture of an older woman wearing a lot of jewelry jack says she used to frequently go to a bar wearing every piece of jewelry she owned just waiting for her long lost love they had called her madame bijoux rose says jack has a gift he sees people he says he sees rose and knows that she wouldnt have jumpedinside bruce ismay is talking with captain smith bruce says he wants the last four boilers lit but the captain disagrees because they are making excellent time ismay disagrees saying titanics maiden voyage must make headlines smith does not want to push the engines but reluctantly complies to ismays demandsjack and rose are talking on the promenade deck as the sun begins to set jack tells rose about how his life has gone he never seems to have any restraints that keep him in any one place rose wishes she could be like that and go wherever she wants jack says she can and that they will go together and drink beer ride roller coasters and ride horses on the beach right in the surf but she has to ride with one leg on each side like a man he says hell show her how and rose asks jack to teach her to spit like a man but jack takes it seriously and begins leading her to a more quiet place where less people are rose is very nervous and tells jack she cant possibly do it but jack spits into the water to give rose an example rose says its disgusting but she tries it after jack pressures her to she spits as plainly as she can and jack tells her thats pitiful jack instructs her on how to do it better and he spits heartily into the water rose tries again and puts her head back a bit and spits into the water this time much betterhe continues to instruct her and rose listens intently but then she sees her mother coming up behind them with her companions rose starts motioning for jack to stop but he has already been spotted trying to spit and so has rose jack turns around and swallows the disgusting concoction in his mouth caught completely redhanded with saliva still on his chin jack quickly wipes it off rose embarrassed starts to introduce jack and explains how he saved her from slipping the night before the other women are very impressed by jack and how he saved rose but ruth is seen eying jack with disgust at his whole ensemble as the dinner trumpet sounds ruth rose and the other women leave to dress except for molly brown who addresses jack while he watches rose leave molly asks if he has an idea what hes doing he clearly doesnt as he was planning on attending dinner wearing just his casual unglamourous outfit molly then takes him to find something more elegant to wearmolly is in her cabin a dinner tuxedo on jacks shoulders she is amazed at how close her sons clothes fit jack jack enters the grand staircase with his usually untamed hair slicked back very well he walks down the stairs and looks around not really knowing what to do and slumps against a wooden post but then tries standing up straighter and more sophisticated as he watches other men walking by cal comes down the staircase with ruth but he hardly even glances at jack because he doesnt recognize him at all rose then is seen coming down and jack does a double take on her jack stands at the bottom of the stairs as rose comes closer to him she takes jacks arm and shows him to cal and her mother cal is very impressed saying you could almost pass for a gentleman they then go down three decks to the dining room where rose begins telling jack about some of the first class scandals she points out a few notables such as john jacob astor eric braeden and his pregnant teenage wife madeleine charlotte chatton and the countess of rothes they then go towards their table and jack escorts molly along with rosethe scene changes to them sitting at dinner where jack is charming the table with his witty and wise comments jack is getting instructions from molly and rose on the side on when to use the table settings at the right time ruth asks jack where he lives and he explains he doesnt dwell at one single place ruth asks how he has the means to travel and he says he works from place to place and got his ticket on the titanic at a lucky hand at poker one of the men with them states how all life is a game of luck cal disagrees saying a real man makes his own luck roses mother asks him if he finds that ruthless existence appealing molly is disgusted by that comment jack says he does and that all he needs is right there with him air to breathe blank sheets of paper and he loves to awaken not knowing what will happen or who hell meet and glances at rose who is listening intently he says lifes a gift and i dont intend on wasting it you learn to take life as it comes at ya to make each day count everyone is very impressed and gladdened by jacks words and rose proposes a toasttowards the end of dinner jack is invited to have a few drinks in the smoking room with the men as the women stay at the table he declines and cal says it wouldnt interest him considering its about politics and business after they leave jack secretly hands rose a note that reads make it count meet me at the clock rose nervously complies watching jack facing the grandfather clock at the top of the grand staircase rose walks up to him and jack smiles and asks so you wanna go to a real party it then goes to a scene of a thirdclass party irish music is being played and people are dancing around merrily people are arm wrestling and falling over from being so drunk rose claps happily as she watches jack whose hair is now a mess again and has removed his jacket dance on a platform with the little girl seen at the beginning of the filmas the song ends jack tells the girl that he is now going to dance with rose rose is very nervous to and doesnt want to but jack pulls her up with him they have to get close for the dance and rose is quite unsure of what to do jack and rose hold each others hands as jack holds onto roses waist with the other and rose grips jack on the back the whole time they move around the platform very fast and rose is laughing and screaming at the same time and jack laughs at roses reactionjack then lets go of rose and begins step dancing to the music rose watches and inspired throws her heels to someone in the crowd and dances beside jack the same way the two add unique steps to the dance both turning and spinning as everyone watches they then dance by linking arms and turning around and around jack and rose watch as an arm wrestling match goes on between tommy and another young man jack steals their beers and gives one to rose a man runs by and splashes the beer all over them as jack shouts after him the wrestling match ends and as they start up again rose stops them she asks if they are so tough why they cannot do this rose gradually begins standing on her very tiptoes as jack holds up the hem of her gown tommy and the other man express how impressed they are and start clappingwe see lovejoy spying on rose laughing in jacks arms from the entrance to the room jack and rose clap as a couple of the people are running around the room

them notices roses handprint and points to it for the other to see they both quietly creep towards the car then one of them opens the door only to find that it is emptyon the forward well deck below the bow where both murdoch and the men in the crows nest can see jack and rose suddenly emerge from inside hysterically laughing and holding hands they spin around with each other and then stop roses smile and laughter fades as she puts a hand to his lips she says to him that when the ship docks in new york she will disembark with him jack says this is crazy rose laughs saying i know it doesnt make any sense thats why i trust it they look at each other and begin kissing againmurdoch smiles at the two and the two men in the crows nest watch with grins as well they laugh and talk about them for a moment and then look back out to seawhere they see a huge looming iceberg lookout fleet phones the bridge as fast as they can to tell them about it officer moody takes the call and relays it to officer murdoch all the crew go on alert shouting iceberg ahead and orders of hard a starboard which will turn the ship quickly to the left below decks chief engineer joseph bell terry forrestal and the other engineers and stokers in the engine rooms and the boiler rooms are in a frenzy shouting orders all hoping to veer away from the iceberg the men in the crows nest watch with concern as they move ever closer and the ship still hasnt moved murdoch desperately hopes for the ship to turn but when it at last begins to it is too late the iceberg punctures the starboard side of the ship jack and roses kiss is interrupted as they look around after feeling the ship begin to shudder violentlypeople all over the ship are shown looking around in confusion including fabrizio who has been awoken from sleep andrews looks up at the shaking chandelier in his quarters the stewards looking for jack and rose in the cargo hold are suddenly thrown against the walls as water comes rushing in and are apparently drowned people on deck watch in amazement as the iceberg moves by dangerously close to the ship murdoch runs and pulls a valve that will shut the watertight doors throughout the ship all the men in the boiler rooms rush to get out before they are all closed as the rooms begin flooding very fast some make it some do not as all the doors close captain smith then comes to murdoch to see what has happened and he explains everything smith runs to the side of the ship and he asks for an officer to find the ships carpenter who will determine how bad the damage is and to stop the ships enginespeople on the forward well deck play a game kicking pieces of ice along the deck fabrizio is then shown looking at the suddenly soaked floor as he begins to leave his cabin tommy then comes running up to him and they leave the deck to higher ground followed by many other thirdclass passengersjack and rose begin to leave the side of the deck they watch as a group of crewmen along with andrews and captain smith chatting rapidly about the condition of the ship the two realize the situation is severe and decide they have to tell roses mother and cal cal is back in the stateroom where roses mother is awake and the masteratarms is because cal claims he has been robbed lovejoy is out in the hallway and witnesses jack and rose solemnly returning hand in hand as they walk towards the room lovejoy slips the heart of the ocean into the pocket of the coat jack stole earlier rose announces something serious is going on and cal agrees as he orders jack to be searched the heart of the ocean is pulled out of his pocket jack and rose both look in amazement and jack yells at rose not to believe he had stolen it rose doesnt understand how it couldve happened since they were together the whole time cal suggests jack did it while she was putting her clothes back on jack then realized that lovejoy put it in his pocket but rose is still skeptical and the fact that jacks jacket was stolen doesnt help either she does nothing as they take jack away to have him locked up all the while jack yells at rose to believe he is innocentmeanwhile on the bridge andrews is seen briefing captain smith the other crewmen and ismay on the damage to the ship he describes that the ship cannot stay afloat with five compartments flooded and that the ship will go down first by the head until completely underwater he announces that there is nothing they can do titanic will founder ismay is in shock saying but this ship cannot sink andrews disagrees saying it is a mathematical certainty andrews estimates that the ship will go under in two hours maybe 20 or 30 minutes more if extra pumps are rigged to keep the water out in the flooding forward compartments there arent enough lifeboats for half the people and smith realizes that ismay will definitely get his headlinesback to rose who is alone with cal and he slaps her across the face a crewman comes in telling them to both put their lifebelts on in third class everyone is being awakened by a crewman shouting to put on their life beltscaptain smith then is shown telling the two wireless operators to send out a morse code distress call that states we are going down by the head and need immediate assistance outside thomas andrews has rushed on deck and sees all the crewmen getting the lifeboats ready for launch he asks one man why the people arent outside and he says they were uncomfortable as it was too cold and noisy they clearly dont realize the seriousness of the situation and andrews is even more disturbed when he goes into first class and hears the band merrily playing music and another man offers him a drink molly brown is in the grand staircase wearing a lifebelt she wonders what is going on like everyone else ruth tells trudy to ready a cup of tea for her supposed arrival back to her room rose and cal are with her rose looking sadly downward all the while she spies thomas andrews pass by and tells him she saw the iceberg and saw the look in his eyes and wants to know the truth he informs her that the ship will sink and cal overhears this as well rose knows how short they are on lifeboats and is in a state of disbeliefbelow decks jack is handcuffed to a pole in the masteratarms office and lovejoy agrees to watch him keeping a gun on him captain smith is informed by harold bride craig kelly one of the morse code operators that the closest ship will arrive in four hours 2nd officer lightoller jonathan phillips convinces smith to order women and children into the lifeboats lightoller coaxes the passengers outside toward the boats while the band sits outside to play in the meantime captain smith aware that they arent enought lifeboats and that the ship will sink before any ships arrive begins to go into a trance aware that his time is numberedin third class tommy and fabrizio are trying to get up to a higher deck but the doorway gate is locked by a crewman saying they cannot pass through tommy knowing the only reason they wont open the gate is because of their social status goes to speak to the crewman outside the first lifeboat is being lowered the seamen are now sending up white distress rockets to catch the attention of nearby ships which there are none around for miles and rose is shown looking up at them along with everyone else they fall into the sea beside the titanic whose bow is almost completely underwaterjack far down below is very uncomfortable being chained up he notices that the porthole in the room is starting to sink below the waterline lovejoy notices this as well mentioning it mockingly to jack he loads his gun puts it to jacks head then punches jack very hard in the stomach and takes his leaverose is watching people being loaded into lifeboats saying goodbye with tears to the men ruth then asks whether or not the lifeboats will be seated according to class hoping they will not be too crowded cal smiles but rose looks at her in disbelief at last saying oh mother shut up she tells her that half the people on the ship are going to die she looks around mortified by the situation then cal mutters not the better half he goes on to say how he shouldve kept her drawing because by morning it will be worth much more molly and ruth then try to help rose into the boat but she bids them goodbye ignoring her mothers screams for her as the lifeboat is lowered cal then tries to stop her realizing she is going to find jack and she tells him that shed rather be jacks whore than his wife he still tries to stop her but she spits in his face the way jack taught her to rose then finds andrews again asking him where the masteratarms would have sent jack he gives her directions meanwhile jacks situation becomes more critical as the room and hallway starts to flood he tries to call for help or pull himself free but it doesnt workrose runs into an elevator cursing as the man inside first refuses to take her down but then does the deck she has to go to is about a couple of feet underwater the elevator man leaves and she stays she runs around wastedeep water yelling for jack when at last she hears him call back with relief she finds him and apologizes for letting them take him she tries to look for a spare key but there is none all the while the bow finally begins to go under she runs outside to find help leaving jack waiting in the flooding room rose finds an axe in a glass case against the wall she breaks open the glass and brings the axe back with her where she is now up to her waist in freezing cold water and does a couple of practice swings with the axe jack tells rose he trusts her and shivering she swings the axe down and cuts through the cuffs freeing him they make their way out of the room and look for an alternate route as the path they were going to take is blocked off by approaching waterthe ship is now about halfway underwater as people continue to give sad goodbyes and lovejoy runs up to cal telling him he cannot find rose they then decide they have to find a crewman who will let the men go into the boatsin a hallway a door is then broken open as jack and rose stumble out one steward crewman yells at them saying theyll have to pay for the property damage but the two just turn around and simultaneously shout shut upin third class tommy is yelling at the crewman to let them all out and he does for a moment people immediately start piling through the door and he locks the gate again tommy screams for gods sake man there are women and children down here let us out so we can have a chance he then goes back down a bit and sees jack and rose there jack embraces fabrizio as he comes along as they havent seen each other in a while fabrizio informs jack that they cant get through cal is briefly shown putting the diamond in his pocket stating i make my own luckjack rose fabrizio and tommy all run to another exit but it is locked as well the steward refuses to open it even as jack furiously demands him to jack then yells at fabrizio and tommy to help him and they rip a bolted bench out of the floor rose ushers people out of the way as they plow the bench into the gate collapsing it the steward orders them to stop but tommy punches him outon the boat deck things are getting out of control as panic is setting in people try piling into lifeboats and the crewmen have to threaten them with guns for the first time officer lightoller points his gun at passengers demanding they maintain order his gun is unloaded 5th officer harold lowe ioan gruffudd in charge of a boat fires three warning shots into the air to prevent men from rushing upon it cal bribes murdoch with money to save him a space on a lifeboatjack rose tommy and fabrizio all rush by the band as it continues to play on deck all trying to find a lifeboat lovejoy has seen rose waiting with jack for a boat and tells cal who turns down a chance to board a lifeboat to go to her a boat at the front of the ship is being prepared to lower and ismay wanting to save himself selfishly boards the boat at the last minute murdoch watches ismay with disgust but makes no effort to stop him as the lifeboat is lowered into the oceanofficer lighttoller then tells rose to get onto a boat but she refuses to leave jack jack desperately wants her to go and so does cal who suddenly appears beside them the two look at him fearfully as he pulls the blanket off her jack has given her and puts his coat on her instead he tries to comfort her but jack pushes himself between them he then tells rose to board the boat again but she says not without you and tries clinging to him when cal insists he has an agreement where he and jack can get onto a boat safely rose at last boards the lifeboat tears filling her eyes as her hand slips away from jack the two stare at each other rose looking horrified and heartbroken and jack giving her reassuring nods cal then tells jack he is a good liar and jack knows there is no arrangement at least none that he can benefit from cal says he always wins one way or another jack looks sadly to rose as they lock eyes again rose looks around at the crying families and back to jack as another white distress rocket is fired up behind him she then realizes she cannot possibly leave him and jumps back onto the ship cal and jack yell at her to stop but she is already onboard again running to meet jack they at last reunite on the foot of the grand staircase they kiss each other desperately again and jack tells her she is so stupid and demands why she did that her response is you jump i jump right he smiles crying along with her and says rightthey continue to embrace and kiss rose continuing to tell him she couldnt leave him and all the while are being watched by cal who is on the verge of tears himself lovejoy pulls him away from the scene but cal spirals out of control and grabs lovejoys gun he starts shooting after rose and jack and they run away from him back down the flooding decks below to escape on d deck they escape into the first class dining room at last they are gone he suddenly begins to laugh hysterically realizing he put the diamond inside the coatthe coat he put on rosejack and rose run through a hallway that is nearly flooded and run into a crying young boy they start to leave with him for an exit but his foreign father comes and pulls him away from them and runs off jack and rose realize they are running straight into a door that is going to burst open with water any second they try to warn him but the man does not understand any english and opens the door anyway and a wall of water immediately flows into the hallway sweeping away the foreigner and his young son jack and rose try to outrun it but cannot they are swept up by the water and when they finally do find a place of exit after nearly drowning they realize it is another locked gate it is deserted but they see a steward come along who reluctantly tries to open the gate and let them out but he drops the keys into the water he runs away and jack feels for it under the water and then tries to unlock the gate jack barely unlocks it in time only unlocking it after the area is completely underwaterthe two begin making their way back up top where officer murdoch is threatening to shoot anyone who tries to get past him into a boat cal tries to mentioning their deal but murdoch just throws the money in his face tommy is yelling insults at him and is suddenly hit from behind by a man and accidentally flings himself forward murdoch shoots him in the chest killing him murdoch watches tommys blood spill down the slanting deck realizing he just killed an innocent man murdoch then salutes one of the officers and puts his gun to his head he pulls the trigger taking his own life his body falls into the watercal finds a crying girl and uses her to get the both of them safely onto a lifeboat jack and rose run through the tilting smoking room where they see thomas andrews staring at a clock on top of a fireplace he apologizes to rose for not making her a stronger ship and has decided to go down with it he bids rose good luck and gives her his lifebelt rose tells him the same and they embrace jack nods his head to him in a salute andrews is left alone in the room as jack and rose make their way on deck again nearby captain smith is watching the horrific scene unfold an irish woman with a baby comes by and asks him where to go but the lifeboats are all gone in a trancelike state he ignores everything said to him and walks into a room inside the bridge used to direct and steer the ship the waterline has now reached the bridge area and is starting to floodthe band then decides to play one last song a hymn entitled nearer my god to thee thomas andrews fixes the clock he stands in front of to match the right time and then looks down sadly struggling to stand upright as the ship begins to tilt further an elderly couple lies on a bed mr and mrs straus embracing as the room fills with water a thirdclass mother tells her two children a bedtime story one that is just enough to lull them to sleep before they all drown roses paintings float in her flooding stateroom fabrizio crying takes tommys lifebelt as cal holds the crying girl and the people run around screaming an elderly man benjamin guggenheim who has dressed his best and has prepared to go down with the ship like a gentleman watches in fright as the grand staircase he is in begins filling with water gentlemen it has been a privilege playing with you tonight says wallace hartley jonathan evansjones the bandleader as he lowers his violin and the song ends captain smith is then shown with his hands on the steering wheel of the ship as the windows burst open with water and he is left to drownpeople are trying to get into a collapsable lifeboat that is still attached to the davits and the ropes have to be cut because there isnt any time to lower it properly fabrizio helps to do so and the boat drops into the water fabrizio swims away and is nearly sucked into an open window of the flooding grand staircase he pulls himself away but is soon killed when the front funnel on the ship breaks off and collapses on top of him as well as many others in the water around the funnel including john jacob astor crushing them at the same time cal is in the collapsable lifeboat with about a dozen other passengers and crewmen which floats away in a wave caused when the forward funnel collapses the child that is in cals arms is washed away by the wave as well as a few other people but cal and most of the others remain on board the collapsable lifeboat also another collapsable lifeboat is washed overboard by the wave with it being overturned officer lighttoller the junior wireless operator bride and several other male passengers and crewmen climb aboard the overturned lifeboat as it too floats awayeveryone including jack and rose is seen rushing to the stern of the ship as it begins raising higher and higher a catholic priest named father byles james lancaster is reciting the rosary prayer as frightened passengers are gathered around him jack and rose make it to the stern and hold on to each other and the railing rose looks to jack and says to him jack this is where we first met jack kisses roses forehead and holds her to him tightly next to jack and rose and hanging onto the railing is a clearly drunk crewman wearing a white gallerykitchen uniform whom is the chief baker charles joughin liam tuohy the ship is then shown hanging in the air making perhaps a 30degree angle between it and the water people are slipping from the stern and are fallingsliding all the way toward the bow and crashing into the water others fall from the top of the stern slamming into the water or hitting the propellers from the lifeboats everyone is looking at the ship in horror and disbelief ruth is looking besides molly brown who says god almighty bruce ismay sees too and looks away painfullybelow decks the chief engineer and his men are still franticaly working in the slanting and breaking up engine room trying to keep the circut breakers in the failing power plant on when one engineer is electricuted when water sprays from a bursting pipe electricuting him on the fuse pannel after that all the lights on ship flicker once and then go out for good second later the hull then breaks in two and the injured lovejoy is standing right where it is broken and watches as many people fall into the electrical fire that is sparking the broken off stern falls back level to the water the bow and stern are still attached together at the bottom of the hull and the bow sinks under pulling the stern with it causing the stern to lift out of the water to a 90degree angle the bow breaks off and the stern stays upright for a few minutes then the stern begins to sink and jack tells rose that the suction from the ship will pull them down he says to grab his hand and to kick and swim to the surface the stern finally descends under the water as both jack and rose take a deep breath the suction from the ship is too strong as jack is pulled away from rose and the two are separated rose blindly tries to reach for him underwater rose breaks the surface shouting jacks name where she is surrounded by hundreds of other passengers and crew screaming and shouting for help in the frozen watera man swims by and starts holding rose underwater as he tries to use her to keep himself afloat jack then reappears and sees this he yells at him to get off her and punches him in the face a couple of times rose is then told by jack to swim as he pulls her along by her lifebelt she tells him the water is so cold but he keeps telling her to swim they come across a floating piece of wood and they both try to get on but their weight combined nearly topples it over jack volunteers to stay in the icy water as rose gets on it alone they stay close to each other and jack tries to calm her by telling them the boats will be back an officer the chief officer wilde a few feet beside them is seen holding onto some deck chairs blowing his whistle shouting for the officers to return the boatsmeanwhile many yards away molly brown is trying to get the women to grab oars and go back to the people in the water they are all crying but do not move quartermaster hitchens paul brightwell in charge of the boat says that if they go back to help anyone they will swamp the boat and be pulled under he demands molly to be quiet and she is for the first time hopeless however officer lowe orders people to make room for one empty boat so he can go backback in the water the chief officer that had been seen with the whistle has stopped blowing it as he has frozen to death the screaming is considerably quieter both jack and roses skin has begun to turn pale with a bluish tint and they both have icicles lining their hair as he shivers violently jack tells rose the boats will be back soon and that they are just getting organized rose watches him and then says i love you jack she tells jack it no longer matters if the boats dont come back for them for she will be with him until the end he tells her not to say her goodbyes and that she will get out of here go on have children watch them grow and die an old lady warm in her bed rose says she cannot feel her body and feels like she is dying jack tells her that winning his ticket was the best thing that ever happened to him it brought him to her as he takes her hand he makes her promise that she will survive and never give up no matter how dark or hopeless things are never let go jack continues and rose swears she will notfifth officer harold lowe is searching for survivors he hasnt found any and things are now dead silent all he finds are frozen bodies including the woman and her baby that never found a lifeboat earlier lowe is sick with grief knowing they waited too long but he keeps looking rose is then seen from above floating on her back on the wood while holding jacks hand near death she is staring up at the bright stars gently singing come josephine in my flying machine her face is then illuminated and her frozen hair crunches as she turns her head to see the disoriented image of a lifeboat she begins to shake her hand in jacks to wake him up from sleep she tells him there is a boat smiling but he does not move she continues to shake him calling his name more fiercely now her smile beginning to fade he still does not stir a few more times she calls to him tears coming to her eyes and he does not awaken she then realizes the truth jack is gone having fallen victim to hypothermia in the freezing waterwatching the boat move further away she cries silently and is tempted to stay there and die with jack but remembers her promise to never let go she tries to yell for the boat to come back but her voice is too hoarse for them to hear she very reluctantly and sadly unclamps jacks frozen hand from hers and kissing his hand drops his body into the ocean she is hardly able to swim but she makes her way over to the frozen officer beside her with the whistle she takes the whistle from around his neck and begins to blow it as hard as she can harold lowe hears the noise and the boat turns aroundin the present old rose opens her eyes and looks at the tearyeyed people listening to her story she tells them that 1500 people died when the titanic sank twenty boats were floating nearby but only one came back only six people including herself were rescued those 700 people in the boats could only wait to die live or for an absolution that would never come the former passengers of the rms titanic are seen floating in the boats very cold ruth is resting against molly looking very sad and molly is looking sternly outward cal is still in the swamped collapsable lifeboat with about 10 other survivors second officer lighttoller wireless operator harold bride and about 20 other survivors are still aboard the overturned other collapsable lifeboat rose is lying in a boat wrapped in a blanket and staring up at the sky totally numb and in shock of what has happened she glances up momentarily as a light sparks overhead the drunken baker joughin and a few other survivors pulled from the freezing water are also nearby in the same boat officer lowe has sent off a green signal flare and is shouting to another ship that has been spotted rose falls asleep then awakens and sees a ship above her displaying the name carpathiaall the mortified disturbed survivors are seen scattered about as cal comes down to the steerage deck looking around he is trying to find rose but doesnt spot her but rose sees him and is angered that he survived whilst jack did not older rose then is heard saying that was the last time she ever saw cal she explains that cal did later marry another woman and received his inheritence and she later read in the newspaper that cal later commited suicide by shooting himself in the head a few months after the october 1929 stock market crash which left him financially ruined younger rose is seen looking up at the statue of liberty in the rain as the ship comes into new york an officer asks for her name and she says rose dawson lewis then tells elderly rose that there were no records of jack ever found but rose didnt think there would be she never spoke of jack again until now not even to lizzies grandfather and says that a womans heart is a deep ocean of secrets but now they do know there is a man named jack dawson who saved her in every way possible he exists now only in her memory the sub is shown returning to the surface and leaves the rms titanic alone in the sea once morethat night lizzie and brock are talking alone on the boat he says he thought of of nothing besides the titanic for three years but never really understood the importance of the tragedy he then looks to the seasome time later rose steps onto the back railing of brocks ship just as she had done on the titanic all those years ago she opens her hand to reveal she has had the diamond all along old rose drops it into the sea feeling relievedthat night rose is seen sleeping in her bed beside her precious pictures she is seen posing as an actress smiling beside an airplane riding a horse with one leg on each side a roller coaster in the background perhaps she is asleep perhaps not the titanic is then seen in its watery grave but as we see further and further into the wreck it suddenly transforms into no longer a wreck and becomes new again and a steward opens the fine polished wooden doors that lead to the grand staircase with a nod inside there is everyone who had perished on the titanic alive and well again fabrizio leans beside the stairs as the world ends thomas andrews looks on happily and then in front of the clock with his back facing everyone jack dawson turns around and smiles in his comfortable 1912 attire he extends his hand and then rose takes it and she is in a white gown young again just as they had been so long ago they smile at one another as they are reunited once more after eightyfour years they begin kissing passionately under the bright light of the chandelier and the entire room applaudsfade out end credits 7.7titanic ship love artist diamond suicide iceberg drawing passenger north-atlantic epic
